If you’re confused about what building a personal brand is, think about a clothing brand, or any other brand for that matter. A clothing brand needs to set the tone for its market to they can understand who or what the brand is. It needs branding guidelines like a logo, branding materials like color palettes and intangible things like corporate culture. For influencers, that translates over into having an aesthetic for your feed, a style or type of content that you’re dedicated to creating, a consistent way of presenting yourself and a tone of voice you write with. In this article, we’re sharing helpful tips to building a personal brand successfully to help you get started on the right track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you missed our previous article, </span><a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/choosing-an-instagram-theme/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking an Instagram Theme</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be sure to check it out, because when building a personal brand on Instagram this is the first step. In short, choosing an overall theme or vibe for your feed will help achieve consistency and a pleasing aesthetic. A consistent aesthetic and editing style also play a big role in securing paid jobs on Instagram. So when choosing your theme, go with a vibe that truly fits your personal style and tastes, are you bright and bubbly? Then go with something bright. If your style is on the edgier side go for a them that’s dark toned. It’s much less risky for a company to invest in an influencer who has a set style and has confidence in what they could expect, over an influencer who was inconsistent in their look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting with your audience is a really important factor in building a personal brand, and more importantly, getting people on board with it. One of our favorite content creators + bloggers, Sivan Ayla, has mastered this art. Sivan, of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sivanayla/">@sivanayla</a>, has 253k loyal followers and not one of them has a single question about who she is and what her brand is. This blogger has been able to achieve such amazing success in building a personal brand for a number of reasons, one of which being personal jokes that are carried through IG stories, personal DMs, and photo captions. This consistency has essentially given her inside jokes with thousands of people and gives people real changes to know her personality and who she is as a person. It’s incredibly important factors that have contributed to both the loyalty of her follower base and the strength of her personal brand. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might seem like a strange concept, but when building a personal brand, creating a branding guideline for yourself and how you want to position yourself in the industry is super important. Writing it all down and having the guide to refer back to will help keep you focused and on-brand at all times. What you include in your brand guideline will vary based on the type of creator you’re aiming to be, but some elements might include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Color concepts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editing themes/preferred filters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logo concepts for a blog/business cards/marketing materials/branding in general</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of focus (fashion, photography, beauty, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood boards</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #4:  Be Consistent</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7215" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Building A Personal Brand_4   Wolf Global Building A Personal Brand 4 685x1024" width="685" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 685w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-201x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-768x1147.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" title="Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024 Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistency is key when it comes to building a personal brand for yourself. Be both consistent and persistent in how you present yourself to brands, industry contacts, fellow bloggers, and especially to your followers. Consistency is what solidifies your value from a monetary standpoint, but also from a follower-to-creator perspective. For example, if you’re a beauty blogger, or cover beauty on your Instagram, it’s important to consistently post beauty content in order to brand yourself as a “beauty blogger” in the industry. The same concept is true across all sectors and categories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We once heard someone that in the first 12 “blocks” of content on Instagram, you should be able to determine who someone is, what they cover and what their focus is. If you reflect on your own Instagram and can’t determine who/what your focus is in the first 12 photos/videos, then it’s time to switch up your strategy.</span></p>

By “smart,” we mean that your collaborations should make sense for your personal brand (and for theirs). Going back to the example of a beauty blogger/influencer, if you’re trying to focus on makeup, collaborations with cosmetic brands, other beauty bloggers and skincare companies make a ton of sense. On the opposite end of that, it would not be beneficial, and could potentially be harmful to your personal brand, to partner with people/companies that were off-brand to a makeup blogger, like Energy Drinks, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite payment, or potential growth opportunities, it’s important not to confuse your personal brand, or the perception of it, by taking collaborations that don’t fit what you’re ultimately about. It’s super important to remember that when building a personal brand.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Choosing an Instagram theme</em> for your Instagram feed is, by far, one of the most important decisions you’ll make when first starting out. Your theme and editing style are what brands your page and your Instagram, sets you apart from others, and dictates what type of collaborations you’ll get. It’s important when choosing an Instagram theme, you go with one that speaks to who you are and what you represent. There are a million ways to edit photos and new editing tools and apps come out every day, making it super easy to play around and find a style that works for you. In this article, we’re going to lay out the steps for choosing (and refining) an Instagram theme and sharing our favorite editing apps.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Choosing An Instagram Theme</strong></span></h2>
<h3><b>Step #1:  Choose A Direction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7199" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Choosing An Instagram Theme_1   Wolf Global Choosing An Instagram Theme 1 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_1-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing an Instagram theme, it’s important to first identify your “angle” or an overall direction for your feed. Do you prefer light &amp; bright or moody &amp; low exposure? High contrast or low contrast? A really simple way to figure out what aesthetic you’re going for is to look at your saved images on Instagram. This will show you what your immediately drawn to and what photos/looks you tend to like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way is to check out Pinterest!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Step #2:  Head to Pinterest</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7197" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest-1024x498.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Choosing An Instagram Theme_Pinterest   Wolf Global Choosing An Instagram Theme Pinterest 1024x498" width="1024" height="498" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest-1024x498.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest-300x146.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest-768x374.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest-1024x498 Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pinterest-1024x498"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/">Pinterest</a> is the holy grail of editing, and a great place to start when choosing an Instagram theme. Go to the Pinterest search bar and type in “<a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/search/pins/?rs=ac&amp;len=2&amp;q=vsco%20formula&amp;eq=vsco%20form&amp;etslf=6718&amp;term_meta%5B%5D=vsco%7Cautocomplete%7C0&amp;term_meta%5B%5D=formula%7Cautocomplete%7C0">VSCO formulas</a>”. In the unlikely event that you don’t already have VSCO on your phone, download it! Pinterest is filled with tons of people who have created editing “formulas” for this app. There are specific settings and numbers for different themes, so you’ll know exactly how to achieve a certain look. There are sample photos and the formula numbers on all of the cover images, making it super easy to scroll through without having to open any links.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you aren’t into using formulas or being that specific with your style, Pinterest is still a great way to look at different feeds and find common threads to the themes you like best. Are they all bright? Do they have muted or bright colors? This will help guide you when choosing an Instagram theme for your own photos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Just a heads up! Not all of these formulas are perfect for every photo. Keep reading for our solution to this editing obstacle!)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Step #3:  Pick Out Your Filters &amp; Stick to Them</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might seem like common knowledge, but the best Instagram feeds get their cohesive look from a consistent editing style. The easiest, and arguably the best, way to achieve this is by using a filter. As mentioned above, VSCO is one of the most popular editing apps out there, and it’s for a good reason. VSCO has a TON of filters and filter packs available for free, and even better ones for purchase. Once you find a set of filters you like best, you can use those interchangeably for the photos that suit them best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7200" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO-1024x708.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Choosing An Instagram Theme_VSCO   Wolf Global Choosing An Instagram Theme VSCO 1024x708" width="1024" height="708" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO-1024x708.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO-300x208.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO-768x531.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO-1024x708 Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_VSCO-1024x708"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSCO is not the only option for editing though! Another great editing app is Afterlight. Much like VSCO, Afterlight has a generous number of free filters and tons more available for purchase. This app also has a feature that lets you add grainy/vintage filters over your photo. We know a number of bloggers who exclusively use this set of grain filters, called “Dusty,” to edit their photos with no other editing aside from color correcting. Very worth checking out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option for filters is Adobe Lightroom. This software is pretty pricey with a decent learning curve, so if you don’t think you would use it regularly, we’d say stick with the apps. The benefit to paying more for an editing software, though, is how amazing it is. Lightroom is an incredibly powerful editing software with amazing quality. Lots of popular bloggers, content creators and photographers have developed their own Lightroom presets available for purchase on ThemeForest, Etsy and other similar sites. The other benefit to paying for Lightroom is that it comes with an app. The app is amazing for editing specific colors in a photo, as well as other basic light and color correcting. It’s only available to those who own the Lightroom or have an Adobe account/login associated with Lightroom, and is probably the editing app we appreciate the most on our own phones.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Step #4:  Think About Your Colors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7201" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-1024x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Choosing An Instagram Theme_Pantone   Wolf Global Choosing An Instagram Theme Pantone 1024x1024" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-1024x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-150x150.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-300x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-768x768.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-100x100.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-140x140.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 140w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-500x500.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-350x350.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-1000x1000.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-800x800.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-1024x1024 Wolf-Global_Choosing-An-Instagram-Theme_Pantone-1024x1024"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Color is probably the foundation of choosing an Instagram theme. Some of the best feeds on Instagram contain similar colors or stick to a set of colors at a time. In most feeds, you’ll see recurring colors within 12 squares of each other to give the whole feed a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing look. It’s important to think about color not only when editing photos, but when taking them too. Planning your outfits/locations/content and feed definitely help to make achieving this much easier.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>
<b>Choosing An Instagram Theme – Pro Tip for Themes &amp; Editing:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In VSCO, you can copy and paste an edit, cutting the photo editing process in half. You’ll still have to tweak little things here and there, but the hard work will be done! Select a photo you’ve already edited in your VSCO library, then click the three dots on the bottom right navigation, now click “copy edits.” Repeat the same process on an unedited upload and click “paste edit.” Viola!

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Getting recognized on Instagram</em> is harder than ever with the expansion of Influencer Marketing and people turning their accounts into Influencer brands. Often, the ultimate (and sometimes constant) goal of an influencer is to become noticed. If you’re looking to build a brand for yourself whether it’s an online one or locally as someone on the scene in your city getting recognized on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is a key part of that equation. Instagram is looked to by everyone for the who and what’s hot for the week, with people leveraging it to find the latest style trends, beauty tips and local restaurant openings. As a social media persona getting recognized on Instagram isn’t just the only goal, but getting recognized in person too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Instagram platform of today, aka with today’s algorithm, simply posting a photo isn’t enough to achieve those goals of getting recognized on Instagram. It takes a lot of finesse, hard work and dedication to get noticed these days. So, now to address the magic question:  How do we make it happen? In this article, we’re sharing our favorite hacks to getting noticed on Instagram.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Getting Recognized on Instagram</strong></span></h3>
<p><b>Tip #1:  Use (The Right) Hashtags</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of using hashtags has been a widely debated topic surrounding Instagram growth for as long as we can remember. But using them no doubt helps better your chances of getting recognized on Instagram. There’s been tons of talk about the dreaded “shadow ban” and Instagram “hiding your posts” if you use the same hashtag combo on every photo. We’re here to set the record straight and confirm that hashtags are incredibly beneficial for growth and exposure on Instagram. Hashtags come up in google searches, Instagram searches, in feeds of those who follow specific hashtags. If you aren’t fully utilizing your 30 hashtag allowance on your Instagram posts, you’re wasting a valuable opportunity to reach a lot of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply throwing a random mixture of hashtags onto your photo isn’t going to reward you with getting recognized on Instagram. Like most everything else on Instagram, you have to be strategic with your hashtag selection. There are a ton of paid tools out there to help you optimize your hashtags and find those that will work best for your niche. If you’re like us, and might not necessarily want to pay for a service like that right away, don’t worry. When typing in the hashtags on Instagram, it gives you a photo count. This tells you the amount of people currently using the hashtag on Instagram. It gives you a quick-and-dirty overview of what people are posting about. We suggest using a mixture of super popular hashtags, and more specific, niche hashtags that really speak to the content you’ve posted.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #2:  Get Tagged</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to grow your reach on Instagram these days is by getting tagged. Working with and getting tagged by a brand, a PR agency, or another blogger is all exposure to that person’s audience. And chances are, there’s a ton of people in that audience who don’t follow you yet. This is great way to work on getting recognized on Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting tagged by brands and PR agencies is a little bit more tricky than getting tagged by a peer blogger. This is because getting reposted by these groups requires amazing content that they think is in line with their own branding and shows off the product in a pleasing way. Typically, this is where the most growth comes from, though, so the work you put in rewards you right back in this case. Tags from PR agencies is great to boost your chances of getting recognized on Instagram by brands and businesses that may work with the agency, or are interested in the brands they represent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting tagged by peer bloggers and influencers is a little easier to attain, and only requires a collaborative spirit and some friendliness! Reach out to other influencers in your area and ask to meet up to take photos of one another, invite them to come as your +1 to an event, or take group photos. This is a great way of getting recognized on Instagram by fans and everyday Instagrammers who might be interested in you and your content. We see tons of new influencers tagged in photos they aren’t in, but were the photographer of! For lots of bloggers, this is a really good way to gain exposure to someone else’s existing audience. The best part about this type of exposure is that it’s targeted. For example, if an influencer with a fashion focus tags your fashion-focused page on their photo, you get the benefit of being exposed to a group of already engaged potential followers.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #3:  Consistency is Really Key</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tip is probably included in every and any Instagram grow articles you’ve come across but when it comes to getting recognized on Instagram it’s no less important. There’s a good reason why. Consistency on Instagram is one of the main ways you’re going to see success on the platform. Why? Instagram is a content sharing platform, and the app rewards you when you use it the way it wants you to (and as frequently as it wants you to). It also comes down to a little bit of logic. The most you post, the more people see your photos. The more you post, the better the chances of ending up on the explore page. The more you post with hashtags, the more exposure you gain through them. Make sense? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another note about consistency is that it lets people know what to expect from you. Do you consistently post skincare videos on your IG stories? This gives a potential follower who is interested in beauty a good reason to follow you. This goes for all things. If you often post cute “outfit of the day” photos, then it gives a fashion lover a good reason to turn on your post notifications. You guys get the picture. Be consistent in what you do and Instagram will reward you!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #4:  Use All of Your Resources</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the topic of getting recognized on Instagram, it only makes sense to utilize all of your resources. Are you on Twitter? Facebook? Pinterest? When you post to Instagram, be sure to use the function that allows you to post to multiple channels at one time. It’s important to foster growth in all areas of social media, because as you can see with YouTube stars who start Instagram pages, all growth will eventually trickle over to Instagram.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick tip when it comes to using all of your resources:  get your PInterest on! Pinterest might seem like an outdated platform, we know. Think about it, though. Anytime you need inspiration for home decor, travel, photos, literally anything, where do you turn? More often than not, the answer is Pinterest. Even a relatively inactive Pinterest page will have thousands of monthly views. Use this to your advantage to help drive Pinterest users, and ultimately potential followers, to your IG page. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #5:  Be Selective and Unique in Your Content</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one might seem like a no-brainer, but it’s not always in the forefront of an Instagram-er’s mind. Far too often, the platform ends up looking all the same, with people getting inspired by others and creating similar content of their own. Because Instagram is so much of the same (the same filter, the same poses, the same clothes, etc.), it’s more important than ever to find the thing that makes you unique. If you’re 1 fashion blogger in a sea of millions of fashion bloggers, you’re going to have to make yourself stand apart from that crowd to earn a follow, and more importantly, keep the follower. So if you’re working on getting recognized on Instagram you have to start by standing out from the crowd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way to do this is to take an objective look at your Instagram and find the thing that makes your page different than the rest of the people in your niche. Once you find that thing, capitalize on it, emphasize it and make it part of your personal branding. This is referred to, in the business world, as your competitive advantage. This is a pretty simple concept, but it boils down to it being the thing that gives you an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">advantage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">competitors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re having trouble looking at your own page objectively, ask a friend or a fellow blogger! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Planning a photoshoot</em> when you’re first starting out with your Instagram or blog can seem like an impossible task. There are so many little bits and pieces to be organized and thought through when planning a photoshoot before heading out with your camera. What to wear? How many looks to shoot? Where and when to take photos? Planning a photoshoot can seem a bit overwhelming at first, but the truth is with just a small amount of planning and effort, the pay off can be huge.</span></p>
<p>Although candid content often times turns out the be the best, planning a photoshoot and working to create quality content is just as important for bloggers and content creators alike. Instagram feeds like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tatjanamariposa/">Tatjana Catic</a>‘s take hard work and dedication to create and curate the perfect pieces of content to share with the world.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good, mutually beneficial option for photographers is to reach out to other local bloggers when planning a photoshoot. Chances are, that girl/guy also needs someone to take their photos, and has the same goals and interests as you when it comes to Instagram. Shooting with other bloggers is especially convenient because they’re more willing to go through outfit changes and the time and effort it takes to get “the shot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True story, when we first started out on Instagram, we worked with a local student photographer at New York University when planning a photoshoot. We found him on Instagram and, considering he was a student and not a professional photographer, his rates were super affordable. Despite not being a “pro,” his photos were incredibly good, almost magazine quality. Relationships like these are also mutually beneficial business relationship in the sense that the photographer gets to build their portfolio and make a profit, while in turn, you get high quality photos and in most cases, even some editing help. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The friends are family option is a little bit tricker when planning a photoshoot. If you have a specific creative vision for the shot, be sure to give them LOTS of direction and hold their hand through the shooting process. When we shoot with a friend behind the camera, we’re sure to hold the camera is a specific position for them to set up the angle, and then jump into the frame. It’s also best to instruct your stand-in “photographer” to take as many photos as their finger can press the button to take. This way it gives you a bunch of options, which increases the chances of you finding “the shot.”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Planning A Photoshoot 101: Outfit &amp; Creative Planning</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outfit planning is hands down the most important part of planning a photoshoot. In a lot of cases, the outfit will dictate when and where you take a photo, and sometimes who’s taking it. For example, if you want to shoot a sparkly top with a flash, you need to wait until after dark to get the desired effect and will need to use an iPhone flash or a photographer who has an external flash for their DSLR camera.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ask most influencers and bloggers, they very rarely shoot one single look when planning a photoshoot. In most cases, outfit photos are being taken 2-3 looks at a time. This allows you to feed plan and stock up on photos so you don’t have to shoot every day to have content. If you’re in a city like LA, it’s as easy as packing up your car with different clothes, bags and accessories. If you’re in New York, though, it means packing a bag and outfit changing in public bathrooms. Somehow we make it work, and believe me, the work is worth it when you’re able to take days off from shooting.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Concept &amp; Pose Planning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concept and pose planning are often overlooked elements of planning a photoshoot. In our opinion, though, they’re some of the most important. We always check Pinterest or scroll through our saved posts on Instagram for inspiration/direction before heading out to take photos. Having a clear vision and goal before a photoshoot makes a huge difference in the quality and creativity of the final images.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also highly suggest practicing your poses in each outfit before a photoshoot. Every piece of clothing requires a different pose to fully show it off. Practicing poses beforehand can also help to eliminate any awkwardness and cut down on shoot time. Knowing your angles is one of the most important piece to a good photo, so the more you practice, the better you’ll get! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to keep in mind is concept and pose planning also help to achieve a better, more cohesive Instagram feed overall.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Timing &amp; Sunlight</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning a photoshoot, always be mindful of the light. Early morning, mid afternoon and at golden hour (before sunset) are the ideal times to shoot outdoors. Mid-day, the sun is directly overhead, casting super harsh shadows on the face. When figuring out when to shoot, try to keep lighting and the sun in mind for the best results!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have to shoot when the sun is harsh, be sure to bring along a reflector. Reflectors help to bounce the light from the sun onto your face, eliminating shadows. This photography tool essentially looks like a piece of soft tinfoil, is affordable and can easily be found on Amazon. Do note, though, that if you’re planning to use a reflector, you’ll have to bring along both a photographer and a second person to hold the reflector.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another aspect of timing that plays into when and where to shoot is foot traffic. If you plan to shoot in a busy area, try to get out there early morning to avoid having too many other people in your photos.</span></p>
<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Monetizing your Instagram</em> is a big topic of interest for many Bloggers, Content Creators and Influencers out there today. If you’re in the influencer world, the ultimate goal is often to leverage your audience and reach to start monetizing your Instagram. Why wouldn’t you? Instagram marketing is a massive industry with an even larger value. Believe it or not, Influencer Worth is expected to be a $10 billion industry by 2020 according to some experts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Despite what we know about the money to be made on Instagram, we know very little about how to start monetizing your Instagram as an influencer. There are so many questions surrounding this topic with answers that aren’t so set-in-stone. When do you start earning pay? How do you start? How much do you charge? In this article, we’ll be clearing up some of the unknowns about monetizing your Instagram and helping you guys to navigate the move from unpaid to paid posting.</span></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Monetizing Your Instagram</strong></span></h2>
<h3><b>Timing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to pinpoint an exact time or an exact number for when to start monetizing your Instagram. It seems most influencers and bloggers start earning money for their posts once they are in the 25k to 30k range. With that being said, everyone starts earning per post at different points in their growth. For example, an influencer with 18k and amazing engagement might receive paid offers before someone with 21k and below average engagement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the timing for monetizing your Instagram becomes more apparent with the collaboration opportunities that come your way. At a certain point in your growth, brands will begin asking you for your rates or will begin offering payment for x number of posts or stories. That’s not to say that you can’t know your worth and ask for compensation before brands do. Never be afraid to ask for compensation. The worst thing that could happen is they say no and then you can still proceed forward with a collaboration on a gifting basis. All opportunities are opportunities for relationship-building.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Fees &amp; Rate Cards</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, when it comes to fees and rate cards for monetizing your Instagram, there is no one right answer. Your fee should reflect your reach, engagement and content quality, but should be within reason. Industry trends and averages will also affect the value of Instagram marketing, so while fees would seem like a stable thing, that’s not always the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When figuring out how much to charge, we suggest using a value estimator tool. These calculators look at your profile and statistics, and determines an appropriate price-per-post for your engagement. These calculators are relatively easy to find with a quick google search and are usually free of charge to use.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have one, we recommend creating a rate card if you’re looking to start monetizing your Instagram. This doesn’t have to be anything extravagant, but we suggest branding your rate card and clearly listing out each service you offer, along with prices or price ranges. If you offer YouTube videos, list it; if you offer paid Instagram stories, list it. Be sure to also list anything that you offer that other influencers might not. Being different and offering more services as an influencer gives the brand more opportunities to collaborate with you and gives you a leg up on your competition.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Approaching the Topic</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an influencer, it might feel a little awkward to approach the topic of payment with a brand, but if you want to be successful in monetizing your Instagram it’s important to break through that. I think it’s important to recognize that feeling, but understand that at a certain point, the work you do to capture great content for a brand, in addition to the value add of advertising to your audience will necessitate payment. Some of the time, this topic will be brought up by the brand and you’ll have the easy job of sending along your rate card and leaving it in the brand’s hands to agree. Other times, brands will specify in their outreach or in the contract that the collaboration is on a “gifting basis,” which means that you’ll receive no other payment besides the items they give you to shoot. When it’s not specified, don’t be afraid to kindly ask a brand if they have a budget for payment. You can always leave the question it as is, or help to justify the means by sharing your media kit, statistics or explaining that the costs will help to (for example) pay the photographer for high quality photos.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><b>Expectations &amp; Realities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s definitely a hit-or-miss thing when asking for payment from a brand, and it doesn’t always go the way you’d expect it to. It’s helpful to set expectations before heading into a situation so you’re never caught off guard. When monetizing your Instagram you should know before going into it that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands might say no. That might seem like a given, but don’t let it bend you out of shape when it happens. The brand is definitely interested in working with you in  capacity, so worst case scenario, you still get to work with the brand you want to and enjoy the benefit of gifted product. In our experience, most brands are incredibly kind when discussing this topic, so don’t be afraid to ask!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands will most likely ask for statistics and Instagram Analytics screenshots. When you request payment for your work, fully expect to have to prove your worth to a brand. The brand managers will have to justify using a part of their advertising budget on you to their bosses, and they do so with your statistics and Instagram analytics. Be sure that you have the numbers to back up your ask before doing so!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment is always quick. In our experience, it takes a little bit longer for brands to pay out from their advertising budgets for a collaboration. It can take weeks after your post went live to see compensation for it, but that one of those situations where it just is what it is. Be patient and always wait a considerable amount of time before reaching out to a brand about payment. You’d never want to come off too pushy, especially when it comes to money.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be prepared for brands to ask for options! When it comes to unpaid posts, brands typically don’t ask for content approval. However, when a brand is paying for the content, they like to see options and typically ask for both edited and unedited versions of the photos so it can be adapted to fit their own feed’s aesthetic. </span></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Engaging with your Instagram followers</em> is just as important to your overall <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> strategy as it is to publish content. Although putting all your focus into creating content, coming up with catchy captions and figuring out the best time of day are all extremely important parts to success on Instagram, the relationships you build and engaging with your Instagram followers can result in big payoffs. We see so many people often forgetting that engaging with your Instagram followers is a crucial part of your Instagram strategies, whether they’re corporate brands, big-name influencers or Instagram newbies, and yet they question why they’re not seeing the results they were hoping for from Instagram be it sales or follower growth.</p>
<p>The truth is Instagram isn’t what it used to be even from just a year ago and between the continuously evolving Instagram algorithm to the over 800 million users on the platform, it gets extremely hard to stand out from the rest and make a name for yourself. They may say not to judge a book by it’s cover but the truth is everyone does so putting your best foot forward on Instagram means having a great looking profile, strong content and a cohesive feed to tie it all together. We’ve got plenty of articles on the <a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/">Wolf Blog</a> if you’re not sure where to start when it comes to an Instagram content strategy. Once you’ve got that all covered, it’s time to focus on other parts of your Instagram strategy, which should include engaging with your Instagram followers.</p>

<p>While it might come more naturally to some than others engaging with your Instagram followers should become apart of your daily Instagram routine. The task may come off as being a little tedious for your liking but you should see it as an important part of your marketing strategy and building a loyal following. For brands selling products or services, this should be seen as an opportunity to connect with potential clients build brand trust with them. If you’re a blogger, influencer or other personality using Instagram to build an online brand engaging with your Instagram followers is an opportunity to build real relationships with your following, and get them invested in your personal brand. Whatever your purpose for Instagram the rewards from engaging with your Instagram followers is a proven method for success.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engaging With Your Instagram Followers</strong></span></h3>
<h4>1. It Starts With Your Caption</h4>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start engaging with your Instagram followers it’s fairly easy: it starts with your caption.

<p>Share anything you want in your caption from a daily mantra, thought of the day or even details on today’s outfit. Keep whatever you decide to put in your caption as short as you can, and if you are one that prefers a longer caption use spacers and emojis to break up thoughts so it’s easier to follow. To encourage engaging with your Instagram followers be sure to include a call to action in your caption; questions seems to work best. Giving your followers something to comment about other than just your picture betters your odds in receiving comments.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2. Acknowledge And Respond To All Your Comments</h4>
<p>The biggest part of engaging with your Instagram followers no doubt comes from responding to comments left on your posts. A user leaving a like on your content is one thing, but someone taking the time to comment on your content generally means they are interested in either your post, profile, brand or all of the above. So it’s vital to capture their attention, and develop some rapport with your audience by replying to or acknowledging their comment.</p>
<p>There are instances where you might receive spam comments from the small group of profiles still automating comments, and this is something we strongly suggest you avoid. In the case of receiving spam comments, it’s your choice to either delete the comment or simply like it, depending on what the comment is and how strict you’re being when it comes to authentic engagement.</p>

<p>Of course there are times where comments left don’t allow for engaging with your Instagram followers, be it because the comment doesn’t justify a response, or because there are only so many times you can say thank you before it sounds repetitive. In these cases, simply acknowledging the comment by liking it is sufficient enough. The main point of responding to all your comments in some for and engaging with your Instagram followers is to show them and your wider audience, that you’re invested in your followers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>3. Build Meaningful Conversations</h4>
<p>Responding to your comments is a great start when we’re talking about engaging with your Instagram followers, but taking it a step further includes building meaningful conversations with them. Anyone can reply to a comment with a simple “thank you”, and although at times that’s all a comment can really be replied with trying to start a conversation with your followers has many benefits. The first and most important benefit to adding meaningful touches when engaging with your Instagram followers is you build rapport and relationships with them. Asking them questions, following up with great dialogue allows you to get to know them while they get to know you through your content. The second benefit to replying to comments when possible with open ended questions, or other forms of short conversation adds a boost to your engagement, by adding a few comments here and there while you chat with your followers.</p>

<p>You can also start these meaningful conversations as we mentioned above in your comments, after all it is the first step to engaging with your Instagram followers. A few great ways you can do that is by adding things like small anecdotes, thoughts of the day, or reviews on particular topics, and closing them off with a question to help motivate your followers and audience to interact with you and your content. Try incorporating these tips the next time you post on Instagram, and see the change in interaction from your followers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>4. Reply To All Your DMs</h4>
<p>Another big part of engaging with your Instagram followers, is staying on top of your Instagram DMs. It’s extremely important to make an effort to reply to all of your Instagram DMs, but we totally understand that it can become a lot to manage, especially if you’re a frequent poster on Instagram Stories. But we promise you, taking the time to put some focus into replying to your DMs will have a huge payoff. This is a a way you can go even further into showing your audience you care and appreciate their interactions. Just like replying to your comments we encourage you to schedule a small amount of time daily, whether it’s first thing in the morning as you do your daily emails or before you head off to bed, to turn this into a habit.</p>

<p>As much as this is an important part to engaging with your Instagram followers we do realize however that it can be a bit much to manage Instagram DMs for some so to give yourself some help with this you can try a few things. First, you can include a small “Collabs Email Only” in your bio, so that brands looking to work with you know right off the bat to email you, saving any important opportunities from slipping away in your inbox. You will of course have a few brands that out of habit will reach out via DMs, and in that case we recommend having a short script saved in your notes kindly asking they reach out via email, that you can easily copy and paste as a reply. If you feel bombarded by DMs from your Instagram Stories, you can easily turn off this feature in your Instagram settings. These two small things alone are known to reduce DMs significantly, so you can focus on replying to the rest of the DMs that come through.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5. Return Your Followers Some Love</h4>
<p>One way you can take engaging with your Instagram followers a step further, is by returning the love and engaging with their profile. This doesn’t have to be super complicated, but ultimately can have a huge pay off and is one of the top ways anyone will recommend to you when it comes to account growth. There are two main ways to go about this. The first is to identify your top followers, those who always like and comment on your posts with meaningful comments. Consider these followers your VIPs and make it a habit to visit their profiles often to engage with their content, which only helps build a strong loyalty and relationship with these users.</p>

<p>The other way you can easily incorporate this into your daily Instagram routine is as you’re replying to comments, visit a few profiles and leave them some love. It’s important to mix it up with both comments and likes, to avoid coming off spammy and also to show a genuine interest in their content. The trick to this is to truly engage with content you love so if you come across a profile that doesn’t fit your taste, don’t force yourself to comment just move to the next user. Going this extra mile in engaging with your Instagram followers has big rewards that will set you apart from other Bloggers and Influencers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Perfect outfit pictures for Instagram</em> something you’re trying to improve? Despite popular opinion, the truth is that getting “the shot” for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> isn’t an easy task. In fact, many bloggers and influencers admit to taking as many as 500 photos per outfit in order to get one or two winners. Whether you’re shooting with a friend, photographer or fellow blogger, it can take a lot of work to perfectly capture a look. In this article, we’re sharing our top tips for how to take the perfect outfit photos for Instagram. Were hoping these tips and tricks make the art of capturing a good Insta photo that much easier!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Perfect Outfit Pictures for Instagram: Tips</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #1:  Plan &amp; Pose Ahead</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might seem like a weird concept, but planning and posing ahead of time will really help you achieve the best outcome when shooting perfect outfit pictures for Instagram. You might feel a little weird standing in front of your mirror posing to yourself, but the truth of the matter is, every outfit requires a different pose to show it off. You wouldn’t pose the same way in a full length dress as you would a denim miniskirt, would you? Taking the few seconds to add posing practice into your routine of prepping for a shoot will make all the difference when you get out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as an FYI, some of the top bloggers out there admit to practicing their poses in different outfits before shooting. At some point, you’ll have done this so often that you’ll nailed down 4-5 go-to stances to hit when shooting for an outfit of the day look. Once you solidify your poses and know what works for you and your body type, it will become that much easier to get the perfect outfit pictures for Instagram.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #2:  Know Your Angles</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be totally honest, we feel like the key to a good outfit shot is all about the angles. Everyone has a good side, everyone has things they would rather hide or accentuate about themselves. A flattering camera angle can take care of all of that. Here’s the quick and easy lowdown on camera angles, and these tips typically apply to both iPhone and more professional cameras:</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Angle (taking the photo from above, tilted downward at the subject)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High angles are both a blessing and a curse. While they can make you appear thinner, then also make you appear shorter.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7133" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle-683x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global Perfect Outfit Pictures for Instagram Angle 683x1024" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle-683x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle-200x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle-768x1152.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" title="Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle-683x1024 Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Angle-683x1024">Low Angle (taking the photo from a lower angle, tilted upward at the subject)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low angles have the ability to really lengthen the legs and make you appear taller. However, they all can make you appear wider or accentuate the wrong features. Lots of people also use this angle to create an artsy look and feel.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straight on (taking the photo from a mid-angle, holding it chest level to get subject straight on with no tilt)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This angle is the most preferable, in our opinion. It does the best job of not distorting the subject in any way, so while it doesn’t help you any, it certainly doesn’t hurt.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #3:  Be Smart With Your Crop</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be simple about it, a bad crop could ruin a good photo. This is especially true when you’re trying to capture that perfect outfit of the day shot. When cropping an outfit photo, make sure you have an area of focus established. For example, if you’re cropping a beach shot in a cool floppy hat, you wouldn’t want to crop out the hat. If you’re trying to keep the focus on your belt and want a “detail” shot, you’d want to center your body and crop to the desired area of focus. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it sounds corny, but do you remember in art classes when the teacher would talk about the rule of thirds? This is when that principle is going to come in handy. Divide your photo in thirds horizontally and vertically and place the focus where the lines intersect. This is, of course, if you’re not going for a centered look and feel.</span></p>

<h3><b>Tip #4:  Accessorize for Visual Appeal</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7135" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Perfect Outfit Pictures for Instagram_Accessorize   Wolf Global Perfect Outfit Pictures for Instagram Accessorize 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Perfect-Outfit-Pictures-for-Instagram_Accessorize-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about your favorite outfit shots. What catches your eye and creates visual interest? What are the different elements in the outfit? We’re willing to bet that more often than not, there are props and/or accessories in play. Put it this way, jeans and a t-shirt is okay. Jeans, a t-shirt, a cute bag and matching belt is better. Good outfit posts are dynamic, complete and visually appealing. All of those things can easily be achieved if you had accessories to bring the look together or accentuate the piece meant to be the star of the show.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #5:  Give Yourself Options</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When taking the perfect outfit pictures for Instagram, be ready to move around, a lot. In addition to trying out several different poses, you should also test out several different locations. Sometimes the lighting is better in different areas and other times the colors just work better for your outfit. It’s hard to really figure these things out ahead of time, so it’s best to shoot in multiple locations to give yourself as many options as possible to find the winner when making your selects. Along these same lines, make sure you give yourself an array of photo “styles.” For example, for one outfit shoot, you should try to get some details shots, some sitting photos, some standing, some half-body, some full-body, and all of these should be taken in different locations with different background. The more options, the better the chances of finding that perfect outfit photos in the stack.</span></p>

<p>Like we mentioned above, there are tons of entrepreneurial inspiration Instagram accounts out there, but so many are ran anonymously, recycle the same basic quotes and don’t associate with anything to prove they even know anything about being an entrepreneur. In most cases the people running these accounts are average everyday people, and sometimes are even bot automated accounts, just looking to capture a high follower count. If real entrepreneurial inspiration, advice and experience is what you are looking for then it’s best you stick to following people who actually know what they are talking about. Luckily, we were able to scan through the millions of profiles and narrow it down to our top 10 entrepreneurial inspiration Instagram accounts we totally think you should follow.</p>

<p>Gary Vee is one of the biggest names in entrepreneurial inspiration, and there’s a good reason why. He started off his career as a wine critic but didn’t let that be what defined him. After early signs of a strong entrepreneurial spirit in his childhood, Gary quickly began finding success in the family wine business, expanding it online and through a webcast Wine Library TV, and in 2009 started a social media digital agency VaynerMedia with his brother. Gary Vee later went on to be an angel investor in social media big names like Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, along with dozens of other startups and in 2017, Entrepreneur listed his networth at $160 million. So it’s pretty clear why over 5 million people follow him on Instagram for his daily entrepreneurial inspiration and big personality. His particular knowledge of digital media makes him a great account to follow if you’re looking to start a digital agency, freelance work or are an Influencer looking to get more insight into the industry.</p>

<p>Girlboss is the digital community started by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nastygal/">Nasty Gal</a> founder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sophiaamoruso/?hl=en">Sophia Amoruso</a>. Girlboss was originally the title of her autobiography, which was later turned into a comedy series that briefly appeared on Netflix. Sophia then took Girlboss and turned it into the the perfect spot for entrepreneurial inspiration for the female entrepreneurs, especially millennials. What is so interesting with Sophia’s perspective on being an entrepreneur is her journey. Nasty Gal went from the biggest social media e-commerce success story of it’s time to bankruptcy all in under 10 years. Sophia’s experience with huge success, and just a big of failures allowed her to take her Girlboss brand and share her experiences with the following she had built as a young CEO in the social media age. We love how bright and fun the Girlboss Instagram is, where they share quotes, memes and other content all hoping to bring out the girl boss in you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Pitching brand collaborations</em> is a big part of Influencer Marketing. As an influencer or social media personality, the ultimate goal is often to work with brands on collaborations that mutually benefit both parties. As a brand, how influencers frame pitching brand collaborations is a big part of deciding to work with, and not work with. There’s a common misconception that securing brand collaborations is as easy as waiting for the email to come into your inbox. This honestly couldn’t be further from the truth. When you’re a new or rising influencer, whether it be on Instagram, Youtube, or any other social media outlet for that matter, pitching brand collaborations is a necessary step in securing a partnership. Reaching out to brands is a really humbling process that sometimes results in awesome new long-term partnerships, one time campaigns, and other times nothing at all. But getting yourself out there and pitching brand collaborations is the only way to get ahead, it’s kind of like the lottery if you don’t play you can’t win. In this article, we’re teaching you how to achieve success by sharing our top 5 tips for pitching brand collaborations and securing yourself more collaborations.</span></p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pitching Brand Collaborations: Top Tips</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #1:  Start small, think big</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first tip about pitching brand collaborations is to start small, but think big. The most important thing to remember when choosing which brands to reach out to is that collaborations must be mutually beneficial for it to make sense. This is a two-way street. In the same way that you’d want the brand to match your own personal brand, make sense for your audience and be beneficial in terms of exposure in growth, the brand you’re reaching out to will want the same synergy from you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also encourage you to be cognizant of size and reach when approaching brands. For example, an influencer with 15k followers will have a much higher success rate if he/she approaches a mixture of brands with similar followings, rather than solely approaching brands with 200k+ followers. Don’t get us wrong, we encourage you to shoot for the stars and pray you’ll land among them, but solely speaking in terms of successfully securing collaborations as a growing influencer, we suggest you start small, think big, and have goal collaborations in mind to work towards. Once you build your portfolio and can show proof of successful collaborations, you’ll have more ground to stand on when reaching out to larger, aspirational brands.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #2:  Develop a Media Kit</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never heard of a media kit? Don’t worry, lots of people haven’t, and luckily, it’s a relatively simple concept to grasp. Think of a media kit as your blog or personal brand’s equivalent of a resume. It’s a essential part of pitching brand collaborations. To provide more color, a standard media kit would include your rate card (if you’re smaller or new to the game, be sure to include that you’re open to working on a gifting basis), past work samples (photos or blog posts), past collaborations (brand names or logos), an introduction to yourself or your blog (location, defining characteristics, areas of focus) and statistics on your reach (follower count, engagement rate, gender and age demographics). After looking at your media kit, a brand should have little to no questions about who you are, what your audience looks like, and what value you’d bring to the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve come across a ton of media kits and we’ll be honest here, they’re all beautiful and nicely designed. If you’re not well-versed in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, or a program that performs similar functions, we suggest checking out <a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. Tons, dare we say hundreds, of very talented graphic designers sell media kit templates on Etsy. There’s a ton of different aesthetics and styles to choose from, so we can assure you that you won’t lose any individuality by purchasing a publicly available template. If you’re still worried about using a template that others could also purchase for use, we suggest heading to a freelance site like Freelancer to hire an affordable graphic designer to custom build your media kit for you. Both of these options vary in price, depending upon the designer you’re hiring or purchasing from, but typically range in price from $40-$200.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #3:  Craft a Smart, Concise and Compelling Email Outreach Template</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our third tip for pitching brand collaborations is to develop a smart, compelling email template to use in your outreach efforts. Developing the language for your outreach email takes a little bit of finesse. The wording in the email template needs to be vague enough to be applicable to multiple brands, but personable enough to diminish any signs that this email is being used across all of your outreach efforts. The standardized parts of your email should include your introduction to yourself and your personal brand (name, age, city, area of focus), a brief overview of your reach (ex/ My audience is composed mainly of females between the ages of 18-25, concentrated in the United States and Europe), and other self-explanatory pieces like your email signature, disclosing that your media kit is attached, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7108" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Pitching Brand Collaborations_3   Wolf Global Pitching Brand Collaborations 3 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more customized, tailored and personalized aspects of your email should be altered brand by brand. For example, the contents of your email and the little details in wording for a skincare company would differ than those used for outreach to a footwear company. It’s important to add a few sentences here and there that show you’re knowledgeable about the company, the brand, their products, etc., and aren’t just looking for free product.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #4:  Pitch Yourself and Pitch an Idea</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short and simple, brands love it when you pitch concepts or marketing ideas to them. Don’t confuse this for offering marketing concepts for the larger brand, but rather offering a marketing idea for your own channel. For example, an outreach email to a brand suggesting an Instagram story take over demonstrating their products is a much more effective way to pitch yourself than just saying “here I am and here are my statistics.” Influencer marketing teams are a growing area of concentration for both PR companies and in-house marketing teams, some of who might be less versed on the different ways to collaborate with an influencer. We encourage you to pitch yourself alongside suggesting an IG story takeover, a try on haul, or showcasing some of their new arrivals in a spring look book, for example.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to make it as easy and possible for a brand to say “yes” to working with you, and that includes offering up ideas on how you can work together in a mutually beneficial way when pitching brand collaborations.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #5:  Friends Who Pitch Together, Win Together</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7110" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Pitching Brand Collaborations_5   Wolf Global Pitching Brand Collaborations 5 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have friends who also blog or have a presence on social media? If so, you’re in luck. When it comes to collaborating, brands really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> care about reach, follower count and engagement. If you can find innovative ways to collaborate with your influencer friends and joint-pitch a brand, you’ll find that you can secure higher quality, more prestigious collaborations. For example, if you and your blogger friend are planning a trip to Europe together, don’t hesitate to reach out to brands in a collaborative effort to pull your follower counts together. If you tell a hotel chain that both of you will be providing coverage for the brand, it’s much harder for them to deny you than if you were the only one providing exposure. Pitching brand collaborations in a team can help boost your odds of securing brand partnerships. This is a super popular method that’s used widely amongst groups of blogger friends in the industry, so don’t be scared to try it!</span></p>

<p>It’s pretty clear how important pitching brand collaborations is to influencers, and we hope these tips help you to grow your brand network. Head to the <a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/">Wolf Blog</a> for more tips on building your influencer brand!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Melon Stats</em> is changing the way we use Instagram, and we couldn’t be more excited about it. As Instagram has changed the way the platform works throughout the years and with the rise of Influencer Marketing, it’s become not only a priority but a challenge for everyone to grow their online brands. Our friends at <a href="http://melonstats.com">Melon Stats</a> are a new Instagram management tool that launched earlier this month designed for use by Influencers. The team saw a need to pair together content planning with overall Instagram strategies as a big first step into creating a successful presence on Instagram, and they decided to pair the two together in an online dashboard that helps Instagrammers better manage their content.</p>
<p>When Instagram first started, it was pretty easy to gain success and popularity on the platform. All one had to do was post captivating content at the right time of day with a few hashtags, and not only did the engagement but the followers just rolled in. Fast forward to 2016 and Instagram’s controversial algorithm had everyone from Influencers to household brands scrambling to keep up their engagement rates and account growth. Since then, growing your audience organically without the right Instagram management tool seems nearly impossible.</p>

<p>This new Instagram management tool started off with two main aspects: feed planning and account statistics; both the foundations to any content strategy. Melon Stats found it important to keep Instagram management as centralized as possible, removing the need for multiple apps to get one job done. Although Instagram does provide some account statistics with Business Profiles the data is limited and not always as transparent to understand and transform into results. And without the ability to plan the aesthetic of your Instagram feed, it’s clear right then and there that just using Instagram alone simply isn’t enough. The dashboard style Instagram management tool is web-based making it accessible from home or on the go.</p>
<p>At Wolf Global, we were so excited to be introduced to Melon Stats and thought it was a great Instagram management tool that many of you in our community could benefit from. With the success of our <a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/instagram-analytics-by-wolf-global/">Wolf Analytics</a> on Telegram it was clear that people were in the market for even more statistics than what was available with Instagram, and it’s clear by the caliber of many of our member’s content that feed planning was of big interest. After getting a chance to learn more about Melon Stats, we decided to do a deep dive into this new Instagram management tool for all of you!</p>

Melon Stats let’s you arrange your feed with drag and drop editing to ensure your upcoming content fits with your feed’s overall aesthetic. With Melon Stat’s feed planner you can also perform minor edits to the image before it’s published.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ghost Follower Reports</h3>
<p>Ghost followers can be a huge problem for Influencers, especially those really striving to maintain an authentic reach and following. Ghost followers are accounts that follow you however don’t engage whatsoever with your content. Melon Stats has a feature to help you identify and remove these followers from your account, keeping your following clean and engaged. While this isn’t the first Instagram management tool to provide this service, having it as an all-in-one solution with all the other features makes managing your account that much easier.</p>

<h3>Growth Analysis</h3>

<p>The other feature that began Melon Stats is growth analysis. The Melon Stats team it was absolutely key to have a wide range of account statistics when it comes to creating an Instagram management tool. With Melon Stats you can track daily growth on followers, media and engagement to see how your strategy is performing. You can also pin point your most active followers, which can help you keep them engaged and build closer relationships with your biggest fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Repost Finder</h3>
<p>A big way many Influencers grow their following is by having their content reposted. Brands are one of the biggest accounts that repost content, using tagged images from their followers and customers to showcase their products or services. Another popular way to get your content reposted on Instagram is by what they call inspiration or feature pages. These pages act as inspiration boards usually covering a certain niche like street style or beach travel that many users follow to discover new content. We haven’t found an Instagram management tool to provide solutions for this, that is until now. With Melon Stats you can find accounts based on your location and niche that are likely to repost your content to help grow your following.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Competitor Tracking</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7069" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Melon Stats Instagram Management Tool_Competitor Tracking   Wolf Global Melon Stats Instagram Management Tool Competitor Tracking 1024x702" width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-300x206.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-768x527.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702 Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702"></p>
<p>In addition to monitoring your own account, Melon Stats allows you to add an additional 4 accounts and get reports on their activity. This is a great feature that many Instagram management tools don’t provide that allows you to stay up to date with what your competitors or peers are doing. The best thing about competitor tracking with Melon Stats is because this feature require absolutely no login credentials, you can keep an eye on your competition under the radar without them knowing!</p>

<p>Hashtag reports is a great Instagram management tool from Melon Stats. This allows you to see how the hashtags both you and your competitors use perform. While Instagram’s analytics allow you to see how your posts reach is ranked by hashtags, it leaves out vital information on how each individual hashtag contributed to the overall numbers. Knowing how well or poorly hashtags are working can allow you to tweak which ones you use to help maximize your reach.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Hashtag Generator</h3>
<p>This is one feature of Melon Stats that intrigued us with this Instagram management tool in the first place. The hashtag generator goes even deeper into your hashtag strategy by helping you identify hashtags based on your location and niche in which your odds of ranking as a top post are. One way in which Instagram changed over the years is how content using hashtags are discovered. It’s important to use hashtags that generate the same average amount of engagement that your posts usually get if you want a chance to be seen.</p>
