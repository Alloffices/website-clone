<p><em><strong>Ever heard of Instagram Pods? From the press – as seen on PlayBuzz – read original publication <a href="https://www.playbuzz.com/mariasusan11/ever-heard-of-instagram-pods" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Social media use has grown exponentially over the past five years, specifically among companies that are supported by bloggers and influencers. Although Facebook remains the most popular, Instagram and YouTube have become the most talked about of the social media platforms. This has been great for business, but has also led to a rise in fake content. That becomes a problem when everyday users just don’t know who to trust.</p>
<p>Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has been successful in removing accounts that appear to be fake. In response, and in order to keep up with these changes, members are using engagement pods to authentically grow their Instagram and attract more brands.</p>
<p>Instagram pods are groups of users who provide high-quality comments on the posts of their fellow members. Unlike fake engagements and purchased likes, these groups provide authentic content that users can rely on. Strict monitoring is a hallmark of effective groups.</p>
<p>Bloggers and influencers join groups on platforms such as Telegram. Some find such groups to be lacking and are disappointed when their own efforts go unreciprocated. However, there are quality groups—such as <a href="https://www.wolfglobal.org/" target="_blank">Wolf Global</a>—that offer administrative support and require strict adherence to the rules. Where others are failing, groups like Wolf Global are blazing ahead with their authentic engagement and careful monitoring by advanced bots. Such groups encourage strong commitment and frequent participation, which benefits active members.</p>
<p>Every year, statistics prove the importance of social media, bloggers, and influencers to brands who want to stay relevant. This means that companies must find ways to utilize these platforms to reach their target audience. In turn, bloggers will become more engaged in monetizing their content through Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. Will Instagram pods be the next BIG thing? It remains to be seen, but this hot trend is definitely worth exploring.</p>

<p><strong><em>How to Get Instagram Famous. From the press – as seen on Medium– read original publication <a href="https://medium.com/@violet.emily.xoxo/the-secrets-to-becoming-instagram-famous-9a163b201a63" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="066a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Instagram is one of the most popular social media sharing apps, with more than 800 million monthly users. Most everyone we know is scrolling, posting, and liking around the clock — but despite the app’s ubiquity, <em><strong>there is still some mystery about how to get Instagram famous!</strong></em></p>
<p id="6a5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do you even begin to have a “following,” much less get more likes? Is it all a sham, or is it actually possible to get “famous” on Instagram? Do you secretly hope and dream for getting big on your favorite app? Do you enviously wonder how your favorite accounts got so big?</p>
<p id="487b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have come up with some pointers and here they are.</p>
<h3 id="65b5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>1. Do your research.</strong></h3>
<p id="a9c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Just like any new endeavor it’s good to set out reasonable and attainable goals. Begin your IG revamp by doing research into your favorite accounts, why do you like their feed, what can you do better or slightly different? Decide what you want out of your Instagram by setting an aesthetic tone. This can be achieved by a certain color palette (white, pastels or dark earth tones). People are drawn to accounts that are visually consistent. The <strong><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/preview-design-for-instagram/id1126609754?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preview app</a></strong> is a great tool for testing out posts to better design your grid.</p>
<h3 id="2b11" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>2. Go for quality.</strong></h3>
<p id="0e3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Take amazing photos. That might sound easier said than done, but there are simple ways to improve your photography.</p>
<p id="f843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fill your Instagram grid with quality images that people want to see — which might not always be what you’d prefer to share. A thoughtful selection leads to a consistent aesthetic, which will help in attracting a core follower base.</p>
<p id="f98a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And when it comes to photo editing, there are a million apps that can assist in the process. Popular apps include <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Snapseed</strong></a>, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">VSCO</strong></a>, and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/a-color-story/id1015059175?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Color Story</strong></a>. Avoid using the Instagram-provided filters and stick to the editing tools: bump up the contrast, straighten your image, add some “structure.”</p>
<p id="69e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">tl;dr:</strong> Get more likes with beautiful, bright, colorful photographs. Remember light is the key to every great photograph. Post vertical images to maximize screen ‘real estate’ and grab people’s attention.</p>
<h3 id="2e55" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>3. Use hashtags wisely.</strong></h3>
<p id="6bc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you can type it, it can be a hashtag. But to make a hashtag work in your favor, you’ll need to think strategically. #You #Do #Not #Need #It #All.</p>
<p id="7548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instagram will let you add up to thirty hashtags in one post, but it’s better to select the top 12 or so that are extremely relevant to your image. Hashtagging the type of photo, the device you used, where it was taken, and the app you edited with are good places to start. There’s also a third-party app, called <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/focalmark/id1161230451?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Focalmark</strong></a>, that can offer hashtag suggestions you can copy and paste.</p>
<p id="3940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Within Instagram, hashtag popularity will pop up as you type. Find ones that are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not </em>super popular, but instead popular <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">enough</em>. #Cute and #travel won’t get you any attention, <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">since</span> your post will immediately get drowned out by all those other posts. But a well-chosen hashtag has people looking at it but not so many people posting.</p>
<h3 id="d0e2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>4. Build on engagement.</strong></h3>
<p id="6c9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Engagement is allowing your follower base to come to know you (or at least a version of you). Consider telling a story or anecdote in the Instagram caption. You can also be witty, whatever your narrative calls for the caption is best area to express that outside of images. When you’re commenting on another account’s post that you love, share your thoughts and try to personalize it so it doesn’t come across as spam.</p>
<p id="c0e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re traveling abroad or staying local the engagement via the local community can be quite beneficial. Through geotags and localized hashtags, engage with the community around you as they may be interested in your posts while you’re sharing from that location.</p>
<p id="ce11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The frequency of posting also matters. It’s best to decide what sounds right for you and what times of day you notice your followers are more active. It depends on what you’re posting, but we’d suggest one to three times daily.</p>
<p id="becc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important to follow accounts that you admire and that post similar items as you and even follow some of their followers to attract attention to your profile.</p>
<h3 id="c82d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p"><strong>5. Join an engagement pod.</strong></h3>
<p id="1842" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If your posts require a little bit of a nudge in terms of engagement then don’t be shy to join an engagement pod that can help your posts get the love they deserve.</p>
<p id="128d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An engagement pod can help you team with Instagrammers in your niche with whom you can exchange likes, comments, views and shout outs. Most of the engagement pods feature Instagrammers from within Travel, Beauty, Fashion and Parenting niche and are completely free to join. Popular pods like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.wolfglobal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wolf Global</strong></a> boast over 25,000 members that you can connect with at no cost.</p>
<p id="b961" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pods are a fabulous way to connect, share and engage with Instagrammers that are just like yourself. Chances are — you will make a ton of friends via these pods to share your journey with!</p>
<h3 id="52a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong>5. And remember what NOT to do.</strong></h3>
<p id="fdbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Don’t act like a spammer, don’t regram other people’s posts. And don’t lose your own sense of style and personality on your Instagram. It’s an app to sharing your life, not to stand in for it.</p>
