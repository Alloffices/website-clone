				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Melon Stats</em> is changing the way we use Instagram, and we couldn’t be more excited about it. As Instagram has changed the way the platform works throughout the years and with the rise of Influencer Marketing, it’s become not only a priority but a challenge for everyone to grow their online brands. Our friends at <a href="http://melonstats.com">Melon Stats</a> are a new Instagram management tool that launched earlier this month designed for use by Influencers. The team saw a need to pair together content planning with overall Instagram strategies as a big first step into creating a successful presence on Instagram, and they decided to pair the two together in an online dashboard that helps Instagrammers better manage their content.</p>
<p>When Instagram first started, it was pretty easy to gain success and popularity on the platform. All one had to do was post captivating content at the right time of day with a few hashtags, and not only did the engagement but the followers just rolled in. Fast forward to 2016 and Instagram’s controversial algorithm had everyone from Influencers to household brands scrambling to keep up their engagement rates and account growth. Since then, growing your audience organically without the right Instagram management tool seems nearly impossible.</p>

<p>This new Instagram management tool started off with two main aspects: feed planning and account statistics; both the foundations to any content strategy. Melon Stats found it important to keep Instagram management as centralized as possible, removing the need for multiple apps to get one job done. Although Instagram does provide some account statistics with Business Profiles the data is limited and not always as transparent to understand and transform into results. And without the ability to plan the aesthetic of your Instagram feed, it’s clear right then and there that just using Instagram alone simply isn’t enough. The dashboard style Instagram management tool is web-based making it accessible from home or on the go.</p>
<p>At Wolf Global, we were so excited to be introduced to Melon Stats and thought it was a great Instagram management tool that many of you in our community could benefit from. With the success of our <a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/instagram-analytics-by-wolf-global/">Wolf Analytics</a> on Telegram it was clear that people were in the market for even more statistics than what was available with Instagram, and it’s clear by the caliber of many of our member’s content that feed planning was of big interest. After getting a chance to learn more about Melon Stats, we decided to do a deep dive into this new Instagram management tool for all of you!</p>

<h3>Feed Planner</h3>

<p>Feed planning is one of the features this Instagram management tool was started with. Melon Stats let’s you arrange your feed with drag and drop editing to ensure your upcoming content fits with your feed’s overall aesthetic. With Melon Stat’s feed planner you can also perform minor edits to the image before it’s published.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ghost Follower Reports</h3>
<p>Ghost followers can be a huge problem for Influencers, especially those really striving to maintain an authentic reach and following. Ghost followers are accounts that follow you however don’t engage whatsoever with your content. Melon Stats has a feature to help you identify and remove these followers from your account, keeping your following clean and engaged. While this isn’t the first Instagram management tool to provide this service, having it as an all-in-one solution with all the other features makes managing your account that much easier.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Growth Analysis</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7068" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media-822x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Melon Stats Instagram Management Tool_Growth Analysis_Media   Wolf Global Melon Stats Instagram Management Tool Growth Analysis Media 822x1024" width="822" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media-822x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 822w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media-241x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 241w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media-768x956.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1028w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" title="Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media-822x1024 Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Growth-Analysis_Media-822x1024"></p>
<p>The other feature that began Melon Stats is growth analysis. The Melon Stats team it was absolutely key to have a wide range of account statistics when it comes to creating an Instagram management tool. With Melon Stats you can track daily growth on followers, media and engagement to see how your strategy is performing. You can also pin point your most active followers, which can help you keep them engaged and build closer relationships with your biggest fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Repost Finder</h3>
<p>A big way many Influencers grow their following is by having their content reposted. Brands are one of the biggest accounts that repost content, using tagged images from their followers and customers to showcase their products or services. Another popular way to get your content reposted on Instagram is by what they call inspiration or feature pages. These pages act as inspiration boards usually covering a certain niche like street style or beach travel that many users follow to discover new content. We haven’t found an Instagram management tool to provide solutions for this, that is until now. With Melon Stats you can find accounts based on your location and niche that are likely to repost your content to help grow your following.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Competitor Tracking</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7069" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Melon Stats Instagram Management Tool_Competitor Tracking   Wolf Global Melon Stats Instagram Management Tool Competitor Tracking 1024x702" width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-300x206.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-768x527.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702 Wolf-Global_Melon-Stats-Instagram-Management-Tool_Competitor-Tracking-1024x702"></p>
<p>In addition to monitoring your own account, Melon Stats allows you to add an additional 4 accounts and get reports on their activity. This is a great feature that many Instagram management tools don’t provide that allows you to stay up to date with what your competitors or peers are doing. The best thing about competitor tracking with Melon Stats is because this feature require absolutely no login credentials, you can keep an eye on your competition under the radar without them knowing!</p>

<p>Hashtag reports is a great Instagram management tool from Melon Stats. This allows you to see how the hashtags both you and your competitors use perform. While Instagram’s analytics allow you to see how your posts reach is ranked by hashtags, it leaves out vital information on how each individual hashtag contributed to the overall numbers. Knowing how well or poorly hashtags are working can allow you to tweak which ones you use to help maximize your reach.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Hashtag Generator</h3>
<p>This is one feature of Melon Stats that intrigued us with this Instagram management tool in the first place. The hashtag generator goes even deeper into your hashtag strategy by helping you identify hashtags based on your location and niche in which your odds of ranking as a top post are. One way in which Instagram changed over the years is how content using hashtags are discovered. It’s important to use hashtags that generate the same average amount of engagement that your posts usually get if you want a chance to be seen.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><em>Wolf Global groups</em> have been around for over a year now, and our community has grown and changed so much since we first began. If you’re new to Wolf Global or have just come across us, we’re a community of Instagram engagement groups where Bloggers, Influencers and other Instagrammers have a space to exchange likes and comments on their content. Wolf Global groups are hosted on Telegram, a chat platform available for both mobile devices and web-based for easy access anywhere. Currently, the Wolf Global community has over 40 groups filled with over 500,000 members exchanging engagement daily.</p>
<p>When we first launched Wolf Global back in 2017, we started with the idea of starting a few small groups to get Instagrammers together exchanging content. Back then engagement pods where big with Influencers but they were mostly small privately hosted networks of 10-15 members. There were originally designed when Instagram algorithms started to take over feeds and Influencers needed a way to work around them and get their content seen. Slowly engagement pods were becoming more popular and bigger networks like ours were starting to appear.</p>

<p>When we launched back in 2017, we started with the idea of starting a few small groups to get Instagrammers together. The next thing we knew we had 10 groups going strong with thousands of members and more joining daily. We knew we had to take the engagement pods and the experience to the next level, and build a strong community of high quality members. We began by optimizing the community with custom built bots to monitor and provide support, and open channels on Instagram to provide information and support to our members. Fast forward just over a year and here we are today with engagement pods, support channels, blog and online shop. We thought it was a good time to reintroduce Wolf Global and go through everything we offer to our members and customers.</p>

<h3>Wolf Global Groups</h3>
<p>We have a wide range of engagement pods for a variety of engagement needs, that can all be accessed on Telegram <a href="https://t.me/WolfGlobalEntry">here</a>. Read more about them below.</p>
<h4>Likes &amp; Comments</h4>
<p>Our likes and comments engagement pods are our original groups. We have 6 divisions of groups: Onyx, Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby, Quartz and Amber that all have a 24 hour likes and 5 post comment groups. Our Onyx and Sapphire divisions also have a 24 hour comment group. These are probably our most popular engagement pods used by our members daily. Our 24 hour likes groups have a 2 post a day limit, the 24hr comment groups have a 1 post a day limit, and the comment groups have no post limits, so long as members follow the 5 post cycle.</p>
<h4>Powerlikes</h4>

<p>The Powerlikes groups were created to give members engagement pods to get quick rounds of likes. These groups are in 10 post cycle and are perfect to drop newly published posts for quick likes. We have 5 Powerlikes groups that for different levels of followers minimums: 1K, 5K, 10K, 30K and 50K followers. The Powerlikes engagement pods do not have daily post limits, so long as members follow the 10 post cycle.</p>
<h4>Viral</h4>
<p>Our Viral engagement pods are kind of a compliment to the Powerlikes engagement pods, created to get quick rounds of comments. The Viral engagement pods are in a 5 post cycle and just like the Powerlikes engagement pods have no daily post limits. The Viral engagement pods are also great to use shortly after publishing your posts since they move fast thanks to their short cycle. There are 6 Viral engagement pods: 1K, 5K, 30K, 50K and 100K follower minimums.</p>
<h4>Turbo</h4>

<p>We started to get some feedback for engagement pods that could provide our members with a significant amount of likes without taking long to complete like our 24hr likes engagement pods, so we decided to open up Turbo groups. These engagement pods are in 50 post cycles, that take a few minutes to complete engagement. We group the Turbo engagement pods in 4 categories: 3K, 8K, 15K and 25K follower minimums.</p>
<h4>Niche</h4>
<p>Wolf Global was created mainly with Bloggers and Influencers in mind, that’s why we launched our Niche engagement pods in order to help them get comments and likes from like-minded Instagrammers. We currently have 4 niche groups for members that cover the biggest niches on Instagram: Fitness &amp; Health, Travel &amp; Food, Fashion &amp; Beauty Comments and Fashion &amp; Beauty Likes. The Fitness &amp; Health, Travel &amp; Food and Fashion &amp; Beauty Comments groups are 5 post cycle groups for comments. The Fashion &amp; Beauty Likes group is a 24hr Likes group. These groups are open to all members, however only niche related posts are allowed to be shared in the groups.</p>

<p>Our Waves group is it’s own unique group from the rest of our engagement pods. For those who are familiar with the world of engagement pods, our Waves group is a rounds concept engagement pod for members. If you’re new to engagement pods, rounds groups work on scheduled time drops where members shared their Instagram username, and their most recent post is then collected in a link list and shared with members. Members then have a specific set them to complete the engagement, or a warning is issued. Currently, we have a Waves Likes group open for members, with 3 drop times daily. You can learn more about our Waves group here.</p>
<h3>Wolf Global Channels</h3>
<p>Once the Wolf Global community started to get big and we had a handful of engagement pods, we had to create centralized places to share key information with all our members. We decided to open Wolf Global channels where we could share things like updates, scheduled maintenance, how-to’s and other information we thought was useful for our members. We encourage all our members to join every Wolf Global support channel to get the most out of our engagement pods.</p>

<h4>Wolf Global 101</h4>
<p>As new members joined our engagement pods, it got hard for our small team to continuously coach every single one with how to use our engagement pods. We also wanted to start sharing tips on using the groups, Instagram and other information we thought would help our members on their Instagram journey. Wolf Global 101 was born, and is a great resource for all our members filled with great reads to help them use our engagement pods.</p>

<p>Probably our most important and in-demand channel is the Wolf Global Entry channel. This is where the links to all our engagement pods are hosted along with the links to our support channels, and other key links like the Wolf Blog and Wolf Shop. The Entry channel is the main portal into our engagement pods and the world of Wolf Global!</p>

<h4>Wolf Analytics</h4>
<p>Along with channels, we opened up one resource group for our members, Wolf Analytics. It’s here where members can get detailed Instagram analytics such as their profile statistics, hashtag reports and post performance tracking. A big perk to Wolf Analytics is it does not require any login information, so on top of checking their own Instagram analytics, members can also check up on their competition to see how they rank amongst their piers!</p>

<h4>Wolf Analytics 101</h4>
<p>We opened a dedicated channel for Wolf Analytics, Wolf Analytics 101, so members had a centralized place to learn how to use the analytics tool and stay updated with any news and information relating to Wolf Analytics. Any member that uses Wolf Analytics is encouraged to join this channel!</p>

<p>In addition to our support channels, we have a few extra tools to help our members navigate our engagement pods. We highly recommend our members utilize both of these tools to get the most out of their experience with Wolf Global</p>
<h4>Wolf Global Bot</h4>
<p>We created our own in-house bot, know as the Wolf Global Bot to customize the way our engagement pods our managed. The Wolf Global Bot is responsible for the main monitoring and security of the groups which includes automatically checking members are completing the requirement engagement. But the Wolf Global Bot does more than just monitor our engagement pods, it’s also a great tool for members to use for support.</p>
<p>The Wolf Global Bot has 2 ways to provide support to members: support tickets and self-service. To manage support issues and ensure members are being helped, we designed a support ticket system where all inquiries must go through rather than messaging admins directly. There are 4 main support areas where members can get help: Warns/Bans, Report Abuse, Shop Services and Feedback. All tickets submitted through the bot are responded to by our team within 24 hours. With the self-service features of Wolf Global Bot, members can check and resolve their warnings in groups, get group rules and be sent the link lists from groups that require engagement.</p>

<p>The Wolf Global Auto Liker Extension for Chrome was created by us as our engagement pods grew as a way to help ease engagement for members. The Auto Liker Extension’s main use is for our 24 hour and long cycle engagement pods, like the Turbo groups. To use the Auto Liker Extension, you must be on a desktop device that has Google Chrome, and pull the link lists from the Wolf Global Bot.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wolf Global Galactic update</strong></span></em> launched today for our community! Our team worked long and hard to come up with the best update yet to give back to the <a href="http://www.wolfglobal.org">Wolf Global</a> community to celebrate our 1 year. We thought out long and hard about all the features, new services and updates we could give to our members as a way to thank them for being a part of the Wolf Global community to celebrate our 1 year anniversary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a bunch of things launch for the Wolf Global Galactic update throughout the days leading up to today such as all Wolf Global engagement groups going totally public, new <a href="http://shop.wolfglobal.org">Wolf Shop</a> services like <a href="https://shop.wolfglobal.org/buy-instagram-verification-badge/">Instagram Verification</a> and releasing Live Studio – our fast shop dashboard for <a href="http://Instagram.com">Instagram</a> related services from Wolf Shop. But today, to mark the official Galactic Launch we’re releasing Wolf Waves, and <a href="https://forum.wolfglobal.org/">Wolf Forum</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to go through every aspect of the Wolf Global Galactic update so you understand everything that is now available through Wolf Global.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Wolf Global Groups Now Public</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably one of the biggest parts of the Wolf Global Galactic update is that as of today, all Wolf Global groups are fully public. What does this mean? We decided after months of keeping groups closed and opening a select few on a rotating basis, that it was now time to open the flood gates and have the entire community fully public. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All requirements will still apply such as follower minimums and niche requirements, but members are now welcomed to move throughout groups and join a few, or all of Wolf Global engagement pods.</span></p>
<p> </p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolf Shop’s Live Studio</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolf Shop’s Live Studio is a new dashboard system where customers can connect their Instagram accounts, without login credentials, and easily place orders for post likes and views. Once your Instagram account is connected, you’ll see a feed-like view of all your published posts and within seconds be able to place orders for Likes and Views.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Studio works on a credit based system, meaning you have to fill your account with a balance before you can begin to place orders. Credits can be purchased through the Wolf Shop.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolf Waves</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve had so many members asked us if we had a rounds group to participate in, or requested that we start one. Rounds groups work a little different than regular engagement pods. With Rounds groups, there are schedule drop times, and engagement must be completed in a certain amount of time to qualify for the next round.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We worked hard on looking at the challenges the average rounds group faces, and came up with Wolf Waves. We’re super excited to be launching our first rounds engagement group and hope to open more in the future!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://forum.wolfglobal.org/">Wolf Forum</a> is another part of the Galactic update that we’re extremely excited for. We wanted to create a way for our community to connect together and have a place to network and discuss things like Instagram growth, tips and general just get to know each other beyond the engagement groups.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/znTHwBGS3Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolf Forum was designed with the classic forum module in mind and has areas for discussion on topics such as Instagram advice, Wolf Global group tips, Loop Giveaways and a section for networking with fellow members within your region or niche. We hope that Wolf Forum can be a channel for our members to share ideas and grow together on Instagram.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s one thing we love at Wolf Global, is giving back to our members. We’ve held a few giveaways in the past, including most recently our Scavenger Hunt where we gave away 1,00,000 likes community-wide. For the Galactic update, you know we had to do it big. So we’re giving away 1,00,000 Instagram Likes/Views!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find details about all our exciting giveaways in our News Channel on Telegram!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming Soon: Wolf App</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest part of the Galactic update and the most anticipated on our end is the announcement of our Wolf App. We’re working endless on this project, and we’re so excited to have our members try it in the next few months. Wolf Global is hosted on Telegram, and we have absolutely no affiliation with the platform. This means, that any Telegram related issues our members face are out of our control and that was something we wanted to change, big time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf App allows access to our groups, Wolf Shop and Wolf Forum all in one, accessible from your mobile device. The Wolf App will be available for iOS and Android devices, you can sign up for our newsletter to get the latest on the official launch date!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many new features and services, you’re probably wondering is there more to come from Wolf Global. The answer? Of course there is! We’re always looking to make the Wolf Global Community better and more efficient for all your social media needs. Expect more growth to come with Wolf Waves and Wolf Forum, and of course the launch of the Wolf App. Not to mention, we’re always learning more about the latest updates for social media platforms like Instagram, so you can always expect updates at the Wolf Shop as platforms launch new features!</span></p>

<h4><strong>The Wolf Global Instagram Engagement Pods Quantum update recently went live through our community!</strong></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://wolfglobal.org/">Wolf Global</a>, our members know that we work day and night to give them the best experience possible and that’s why we worked on and hard on this Quantum launch which provided key updates to both our group monitoring and security systems and member tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a big portion of the Wolf Global Instagram Engagement Pods Quantum update was to enhance our member experience and tools available to them, there was also a lot of behind scenes security and monitoring features that we added thanks to the feedback of our community. These updates to our monitoring and security features help create a safer and more enjoyable engagement pod community built on integrity.</span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group Monitoring &amp; Security</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We added a feature to create controls around post limits in our 24 hour cycle groups so no one can take advantage of our busiest groups and over-share content. Users will now be notified with a message within their group and have their drops deleted by the bot within seconds of dropping, to keep the groups fair and even amongst members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big request we kept having from our members were better controls for spam-like or low quality comments from members abusing our community. Although our team of admins worked hard at manually checking comment quality, with us reaching over 300,000 members and thousands of drops daily, it became nearly impossible to monitor to our standards. Our monitoring system can now detect comments that seem spammy, low quality or that do not meet our word count minimums in order to enforce better give and take of engagement between our members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final control we put in place to keep the quality of our groups to both our standards and those of our members, was link formats within our 24hr cycle groups. A lot of confusion was starting to arise, especially in our groups open to new members, when drop formats went from D24H + Link to Dx24 + Link. New members, without reading the group rules, would assume the cycle was a 24 post cycle rather than a 24hr cycle diluting the overall quality of the groups. Now, when members drop posts without following the correct format they will be notified in the group by the bot, their post removed and asked to drop their links in the correct format.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some of these new monitoring and security features will take a bit of a learning curve for some to adjust to, especially our long-term members, they were all put in place after member recommendations and feedback in order to improve the overall quality of the Wolf Global community. We are sure that in no time our members will happily adjust and notice the overall benefits of these changes. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Member Tool Highlights</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf Global Instagram Engagement Pods Quantum update brought a brand new feature to Wolf Global groups for members – inline commands. Instead of having to chat directly with our interactive bot and navigate menu options, Wolf Global members can now type commands directly into the group in which they require assistance or tools from the bot. Within seconds the bot will reply to the user with a private message returning the information requested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can begin to use these features you must ensure that you’ve previously started the bot, or it will not be able to send you direct messages with replies. To do this, message @WolfGlobal_Bot and hit the start button located at the bottom of the chat feed, where you’d usually type a message. Once you do this, the typing area will appear and the bot will officially be activated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy access to group rules was one of our first priority when developing this update. Members looking for group rules can now type /rules and the rules for the group in which the command was typed will be sent directly to them in seconds by the bot. This is a great feature for those looking to quickly confirm group terms like engagement requirements or cycle length before they begin using it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our most popular support issues we deal with on a daily basis for our members are group warnings. So when working on our update we had to make checking your warns for a specific group is simpler than ever! Our members can now type in /check and the bot will send you a warn report for that specific group, instead of having to once again navigate the bot to check you report. Within seconds you can easily see if you have any warns you might not have noticed before you drop in our groups, significantly reducing your risk of being banned.  You can then work within the bot as normal to resolve and remove your warn before proceeding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but certainly not least is the ability to now request link lists to catch-up directly within groups to either then use with our <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wolf-global-auto-liker-21/ljpdpanbbfdbjohleahjacncdnohialj">Autoliker Extension for Chrome</a> or manually. To receive a list of links from the bot, just type /linklist into the group. It’s important to note that this function only works in long-cycle likes groups like 24HR Likes and long-cycle groups like our Turbo Likes where the cycle is 50 links.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these new features with the Wolf Global Instagram Engagement Pods Quantum update makes using our engagement groups that much easier and time efficient, something that our members have been asking for. But that is even more important to us, is that our security and monitoring updates have made our groups and overall community operate with more integrity. Our back end updates have made it more accurate than ever detect low quality members, spam accounts, leechers and other undesired accounts which we’ve determined thanks to the help of our members. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a recommendation you’d like to share with us to improve the Wolf Global community or have an idea for a new tool or concept? You can reach out to us and send feedback directly through our interactive bot. Message the @WolfGlobal_Bot and hit start if this is your first time activating it. Now type /help to get the main command centre, and then click on the Feedback option to open a ticket. Your feedback will be sent to our Operations team to review and for consideration. Although we may not reply to all feedback submissions, or act on all recommendations but we try our best to give our community of Instagrammers and Online Influencers all the tools and services they need to reach their goals! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvnN6YimXI"><strong>Instagram Analytics by Wolf Global</strong></a></span> recently launched in Beta mode to provide our members with crucial information on their Instagram accounts and activity to boost their online presence. We worked for months to bring together this project and we are so excited to have our members using it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/free-instagram-analytics-tool/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wolf Global Analytics</span></a> is accessed through a group on Telegram, similar to our Instagram engagement pods. Access to Wolf Global Analytics is available through the Wolf Global Entry channel and provides our members with insights on their Instagram accounts ranging from account health, media statistics, post tracking and even provides information on Hashtags. We decided to break down how our Instagram Analytics work and how you can use them to your advantage to get ahead.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolf Global Analytics is open to all Wolf Global members, however certain analytical functions are restricted to premium members. Currently, Wolf Global Analytics has 5 different reports it can provide members. To gather specific reports, members will type in the respect command followed by the Instagram account (including the @) they’re looking to run reports on. Let’s walk through each report, how to pull it and how this information can benefit your Instagram Content Strategy</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Account Statistics</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6442" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Instagram Analytics by Wolf Global   WolfGlobal InstagramAnalytics AccountStats 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-1024x683 WolfGlobal_InstagramAnalytics_AccountStats-1024x683"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Available to all Wolf Global members is Account Statistics, which accessible with the /stats command and provides basic information on your such as follower count and engagement ratios. This report is great to learn in detail how Instagrammers engage with your content, but can also be used to check up on your competitors performance.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Media Report </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media Reports is available to all members with Junior level access and gives members a report on all published content on your account such as total posts and daily average posts. This is great to understand posting patterns to better strategize your content and can be accessed with the /media command. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wolf Global, we work hard to deliver a community and tools for our members to maximize their Instagram experience. We’ve created over 30 groups for our members to exchange engagement and network with other Instagrammers, built and are continuously developing our interactive Concierge WolfGlobal_Bot and launched our Auto Liker extension for Google Chrome. One project we are super excited to be launching soon and that we think you are going to love is <strong>Wolf Analytics – a Free Instagram Analytics Tool.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We developed Wolf Analytics thanks to the feedback from our community of over 75,000 members wanting to have access to more data surrounding their Instagram account performance so they can better understand how to use engagement pods to their advantage. We spent the last few weeks as a team brainstorming and compiling feedback to put together this new tool to help you with features like tracking your post performance with live metrics, determining probability of reaching top post and explore pages, reports on media and hashtag analytics and more! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolf Analytics is expecting to launch with a few different tools but as with every Wolf Global tool or service, we plan on growing our analytics offerings. The 3 main features we are exciting to be rolling out are Account Statistics, Hashtag Reports and Post Tracking. Wolf Analytics as with all our offerings will remain 100% free however certain advanced features will require a small fee to access them.</span></p>

There are also power like and viral groups with minimum follower requirements designed to send content to the top ranks for any location or hashtag. Through mutual engagement, likes, and high-quality content, members can boost each other’s profiles while finding like-minded Instagrammers looking to connect.</p>

<p>Wolf Global plans to continue expanding into 2018, including opening niche-specific and location-based groups to help members precisely target their engagement while continuing to grow the number of individual members within their network.
