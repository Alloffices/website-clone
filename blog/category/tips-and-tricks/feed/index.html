If you’re confused about what building a personal brand is, think about a clothing brand, or any other brand for that matter. A clothing brand needs to set the tone for its market to they can understand who or what the brand is. It needs branding guidelines like a logo, branding materials like color palettes and intangible things like corporate culture. For influencers, that translates over into having an aesthetic for your feed, a style or type of content that you’re dedicated to creating, a consistent way of presenting yourself and a tone of voice you write with. In this article, we’re sharing helpful tips to building a personal brand successfully to help you get started on the right track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you missed our previous article, </span><a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/choosing-an-instagram-theme/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking an Instagram Theme</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be sure to check it out, because when building a personal brand on Instagram this is the first step. In short, choosing an overall theme or vibe for your feed will help achieve consistency and a pleasing aesthetic. A consistent aesthetic and editing style also play a big role in securing paid jobs on Instagram. So when choosing your theme, go with a vibe that truly fits your personal style and tastes, are you bright and bubbly? Then go with something bright. If your style is on the edgier side go for a them that’s dark toned. It’s much less risky for a company to invest in an influencer who has a set style and has confidence in what they could expect, over an influencer who was inconsistent in their look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting with your audience is a really important factor in building a personal brand, and more importantly, getting people on board with it. One of our favorite content creators + bloggers, Sivan Ayla, has mastered this art. Sivan, of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sivanayla/">@sivanayla</a>, has 253k loyal followers and not one of them has a single question about who she is and what her brand is. This blogger has been able to achieve such amazing success in building a personal brand for a number of reasons, one of which being personal jokes that are carried through IG stories, personal DMs, and photo captions. This consistency has essentially given her inside jokes with thousands of people and gives people real changes to know her personality and who she is as a person. It’s incredibly important factors that have contributed to both the loyalty of her follower base and the strength of her personal brand. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might seem like a strange concept, but when building a personal brand, creating a branding guideline for yourself and how you want to position yourself in the industry is super important. Writing it all down and having the guide to refer back to will help keep you focused and on-brand at all times. What you include in your brand guideline will vary based on the type of creator you’re aiming to be, but some elements might include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Color concepts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editing themes/preferred filters</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logo concepts for a blog/business cards/marketing materials/branding in general</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of focus (fashion, photography, beauty, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood boards</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #4:  Be Consistent</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7215" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Building A Personal Brand_4   Wolf Global Building A Personal Brand 4 685x1024" width="685" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 685w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-201x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-768x1147.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" title="Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024 Wolf-Global_Building-A-Personal-Brand_4-685x1024"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consistency is key when it comes to building a personal brand for yourself. Be both consistent and persistent in how you present yourself to brands, industry contacts, fellow bloggers, and especially to your followers. Consistency is what solidifies your value from a monetary standpoint, but also from a follower-to-creator perspective. For example, if you’re a beauty blogger, or cover beauty on your Instagram, it’s important to consistently post beauty content in order to brand yourself as a “beauty blogger” in the industry. The same concept is true across all sectors and categories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We once heard someone that in the first 12 “blocks” of content on Instagram, you should be able to determine who someone is, what they cover and what their focus is. If you reflect on your own Instagram and can’t determine who/what your focus is in the first 12 photos/videos, then it’s time to switch up your strategy.</span></p>

By “smart,” we mean that your collaborations should make sense for your personal brand (and for theirs). Going back to the example of a beauty blogger/influencer, if you’re trying to focus on makeup, collaborations with cosmetic brands, other beauty bloggers and skincare companies make a ton of sense. On the opposite end of that, it would not be beneficial, and could potentially be harmful to your personal brand, to partner with people/companies that were off-brand to a makeup blogger, like Energy Drinks, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite payment, or potential growth opportunities, it’s important not to confuse your personal brand, or the perception of it, by taking collaborations that don’t fit what you’re ultimately about. It’s super important to remember that when building a personal brand.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Getting recognized on Instagram</em> is harder than ever with the expansion of Influencer Marketing and people turning their accounts into Influencer brands. Often, the ultimate (and sometimes constant) goal of an influencer is to become noticed. If you’re looking to build a brand for yourself whether it’s an online one or locally as someone on the scene in your city getting recognized on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is a key part of that equation. Instagram is looked to by everyone for the who and what’s hot for the week, with people leveraging it to find the latest style trends, beauty tips and local restaurant openings. As a social media persona getting recognized on Instagram isn’t just the only goal, but getting recognized in person too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Instagram platform of today, aka with today’s algorithm, simply posting a photo isn’t enough to achieve those goals of getting recognized on Instagram. It takes a lot of finesse, hard work and dedication to get noticed these days. So, now to address the magic question:  How do we make it happen? In this article, we’re sharing our favorite hacks to getting noticed on Instagram.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Getting Recognized on Instagram</strong></span></h3>
<p><b>Tip #1:  Use (The Right) Hashtags</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of using hashtags has been a widely debated topic surrounding Instagram growth for as long as we can remember. But using them no doubt helps better your chances of getting recognized on Instagram. There’s been tons of talk about the dreaded “shadow ban” and Instagram “hiding your posts” if you use the same hashtag combo on every photo. We’re here to set the record straight and confirm that hashtags are incredibly beneficial for growth and exposure on Instagram. Hashtags come up in google searches, Instagram searches, in feeds of those who follow specific hashtags. If you aren’t fully utilizing your 30 hashtag allowance on your Instagram posts, you’re wasting a valuable opportunity to reach a lot of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply throwing a random mixture of hashtags onto your photo isn’t going to reward you with getting recognized on Instagram. Like most everything else on Instagram, you have to be strategic with your hashtag selection. There are a ton of paid tools out there to help you optimize your hashtags and find those that will work best for your niche. If you’re like us, and might not necessarily want to pay for a service like that right away, don’t worry. When typing in the hashtags on Instagram, it gives you a photo count. This tells you the amount of people currently using the hashtag on Instagram. It gives you a quick-and-dirty overview of what people are posting about. We suggest using a mixture of super popular hashtags, and more specific, niche hashtags that really speak to the content you’ve posted.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #2:  Get Tagged</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to grow your reach on Instagram these days is by getting tagged. Working with and getting tagged by a brand, a PR agency, or another blogger is all exposure to that person’s audience. And chances are, there’s a ton of people in that audience who don’t follow you yet. This is great way to work on getting recognized on Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting tagged by brands and PR agencies is a little bit more tricky than getting tagged by a peer blogger. This is because getting reposted by these groups requires amazing content that they think is in line with their own branding and shows off the product in a pleasing way. Typically, this is where the most growth comes from, though, so the work you put in rewards you right back in this case. Tags from PR agencies is great to boost your chances of getting recognized on Instagram by brands and businesses that may work with the agency, or are interested in the brands they represent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting tagged by peer bloggers and influencers is a little easier to attain, and only requires a collaborative spirit and some friendliness! Reach out to other influencers in your area and ask to meet up to take photos of one another, invite them to come as your +1 to an event, or take group photos. This is a great way of getting recognized on Instagram by fans and everyday Instagrammers who might be interested in you and your content. We see tons of new influencers tagged in photos they aren’t in, but were the photographer of! For lots of bloggers, this is a really good way to gain exposure to someone else’s existing audience. The best part about this type of exposure is that it’s targeted. For example, if an influencer with a fashion focus tags your fashion-focused page on their photo, you get the benefit of being exposed to a group of already engaged potential followers.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #3:  Consistency is Really Key</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tip is probably included in every and any Instagram grow articles you’ve come across but when it comes to getting recognized on Instagram it’s no less important. There’s a good reason why. Consistency on Instagram is one of the main ways you’re going to see success on the platform. Why? Instagram is a content sharing platform, and the app rewards you when you use it the way it wants you to (and as frequently as it wants you to). It also comes down to a little bit of logic. The most you post, the more people see your photos. The more you post, the better the chances of ending up on the explore page. The more you post with hashtags, the more exposure you gain through them. Make sense? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another note about consistency is that it lets people know what to expect from you. Do you consistently post skincare videos on your IG stories? This gives a potential follower who is interested in beauty a good reason to follow you. This goes for all things. If you often post cute “outfit of the day” photos, then it gives a fashion lover a good reason to turn on your post notifications. You guys get the picture. Be consistent in what you do and Instagram will reward you!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #4:  Use All of Your Resources</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the topic of getting recognized on Instagram, it only makes sense to utilize all of your resources. Are you on Twitter? Facebook? Pinterest? When you post to Instagram, be sure to use the function that allows you to post to multiple channels at one time. It’s important to foster growth in all areas of social media, because as you can see with YouTube stars who start Instagram pages, all growth will eventually trickle over to Instagram.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick tip when it comes to using all of your resources:  get your PInterest on! Pinterest might seem like an outdated platform, we know. Think about it, though. Anytime you need inspiration for home decor, travel, photos, literally anything, where do you turn? More often than not, the answer is Pinterest. Even a relatively inactive Pinterest page will have thousands of monthly views. Use this to your advantage to help drive Pinterest users, and ultimately potential followers, to your IG page. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Tip #5:  Be Selective and Unique in Your Content</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one might seem like a no-brainer, but it’s not always in the forefront of an Instagram-er’s mind. Far too often, the platform ends up looking all the same, with people getting inspired by others and creating similar content of their own. Because Instagram is so much of the same (the same filter, the same poses, the same clothes, etc.), it’s more important than ever to find the thing that makes you unique. If you’re 1 fashion blogger in a sea of millions of fashion bloggers, you’re going to have to make yourself stand apart from that crowd to earn a follow, and more importantly, keep the follower. So if you’re working on getting recognized on Instagram you have to start by standing out from the crowd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way to do this is to take an objective look at your Instagram and find the thing that makes your page different than the rest of the people in your niche. Once you find that thing, capitalize on it, emphasize it and make it part of your personal branding. This is referred to, in the business world, as your competitive advantage. This is a pretty simple concept, but it boils down to it being the thing that gives you an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">advantage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">competitors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re having trouble looking at your own page objectively, ask a friend or a fellow blogger! </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Monetizing your Instagram</em> is a big topic of interest for many Bloggers, Content Creators and Influencers out there today. If you’re in the influencer world, the ultimate goal is often to leverage your audience and reach to start monetizing your Instagram. Why wouldn’t you? Instagram marketing is a massive industry with an even larger value. Believe it or not, Influencer Worth is expected to be a $10 billion industry by 2020 according to some experts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Despite what we know about the money to be made on Instagram, we know very little about how to start monetizing your Instagram as an influencer. There are so many questions surrounding this topic with answers that aren’t so set-in-stone. When do you start earning pay? How do you start? How much do you charge? In this article, we’ll be clearing up some of the unknowns about monetizing your Instagram and helping you guys to navigate the move from unpaid to paid posting.</span></p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Monetizing Your Instagram</strong></span></h2>
<h3><b>Timing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to pinpoint an exact time or an exact number for when to start monetizing your Instagram. It seems most influencers and bloggers start earning money for their posts once they are in the 25k to 30k range. With that being said, everyone starts earning per post at different points in their growth. For example, an influencer with 18k and amazing engagement might receive paid offers before someone with 21k and below average engagement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the timing for monetizing your Instagram becomes more apparent with the collaboration opportunities that come your way. At a certain point in your growth, brands will begin asking you for your rates or will begin offering payment for x number of posts or stories. That’s not to say that you can’t know your worth and ask for compensation before brands do. Never be afraid to ask for compensation. The worst thing that could happen is they say no and then you can still proceed forward with a collaboration on a gifting basis. All opportunities are opportunities for relationship-building.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Fees &amp; Rate Cards</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, when it comes to fees and rate cards for monetizing your Instagram, there is no one right answer. Your fee should reflect your reach, engagement and content quality, but should be within reason. Industry trends and averages will also affect the value of Instagram marketing, so while fees would seem like a stable thing, that’s not always the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When figuring out how much to charge, we suggest using a value estimator tool. These calculators look at your profile and statistics, and determines an appropriate price-per-post for your engagement. These calculators are relatively easy to find with a quick google search and are usually free of charge to use.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have one, we recommend creating a rate card if you’re looking to start monetizing your Instagram. This doesn’t have to be anything extravagant, but we suggest branding your rate card and clearly listing out each service you offer, along with prices or price ranges. If you offer YouTube videos, list it; if you offer paid Instagram stories, list it. Be sure to also list anything that you offer that other influencers might not. Being different and offering more services as an influencer gives the brand more opportunities to collaborate with you and gives you a leg up on your competition.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Approaching the Topic</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an influencer, it might feel a little awkward to approach the topic of payment with a brand, but if you want to be successful in monetizing your Instagram it’s important to break through that. I think it’s important to recognize that feeling, but understand that at a certain point, the work you do to capture great content for a brand, in addition to the value add of advertising to your audience will necessitate payment. Some of the time, this topic will be brought up by the brand and you’ll have the easy job of sending along your rate card and leaving it in the brand’s hands to agree. Other times, brands will specify in their outreach or in the contract that the collaboration is on a “gifting basis,” which means that you’ll receive no other payment besides the items they give you to shoot. When it’s not specified, don’t be afraid to kindly ask a brand if they have a budget for payment. You can always leave the question it as is, or help to justify the means by sharing your media kit, statistics or explaining that the costs will help to (for example) pay the photographer for high quality photos.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><b>Expectations &amp; Realities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s definitely a hit-or-miss thing when asking for payment from a brand, and it doesn’t always go the way you’d expect it to. It’s helpful to set expectations before heading into a situation so you’re never caught off guard. When monetizing your Instagram you should know before going into it that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands might say no. That might seem like a given, but don’t let it bend you out of shape when it happens. The brand is definitely interested in working with you in  capacity, so worst case scenario, you still get to work with the brand you want to and enjoy the benefit of gifted product. In our experience, most brands are incredibly kind when discussing this topic, so don’t be afraid to ask!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands will most likely ask for statistics and Instagram Analytics screenshots. When you request payment for your work, fully expect to have to prove your worth to a brand. The brand managers will have to justify using a part of their advertising budget on you to their bosses, and they do so with your statistics and Instagram analytics. Be sure that you have the numbers to back up your ask before doing so!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment is always quick. In our experience, it takes a little bit longer for brands to pay out from their advertising budgets for a collaboration. It can take weeks after your post went live to see compensation for it, but that one of those situations where it just is what it is. Be patient and always wait a considerable amount of time before reaching out to a brand about payment. You’d never want to come off too pushy, especially when it comes to money.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be prepared for brands to ask for options! When it comes to unpaid posts, brands typically don’t ask for content approval. However, when a brand is paying for the content, they like to see options and typically ask for both edited and unedited versions of the photos so it can be adapted to fit their own feed’s aesthetic. </span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Engaging with your Instagram followers</em> is just as important to your overall <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> strategy as it is to publish content. Although putting all your focus into creating content, coming up with catchy captions and figuring out the best time of day are all extremely important parts to success on Instagram, the relationships you build and engaging with your Instagram followers can result in big payoffs. We see so many people often forgetting that engaging with your Instagram followers is a crucial part of your Instagram strategies, whether they’re corporate brands, big-name influencers or Instagram newbies, and yet they question why they’re not seeing the results they were hoping for from Instagram be it sales or follower growth.</p>
<p>The truth is Instagram isn’t what it used to be even from just a year ago and between the continuously evolving Instagram algorithm to the over 800 million users on the platform, it gets extremely hard to stand out from the rest and make a name for yourself. They may say not to judge a book by it’s cover but the truth is everyone does so putting your best foot forward on Instagram means having a great looking profile, strong content and a cohesive feed to tie it all together. We’ve got plenty of articles on the <a href="https://wolfglobal.org/blog/">Wolf Blog</a> if you’re not sure where to start when it comes to an Instagram content strategy. Once you’ve got that all covered, it’s time to focus on other parts of your Instagram strategy, which should include engaging with your Instagram followers.</p>

<p>While it might come more naturally to some than others engaging with your Instagram followers should become apart of your daily Instagram routine. The task may come off as being a little tedious for your liking but you should see it as an important part of your marketing strategy and building a loyal following. For brands selling products or services, this should be seen as an opportunity to connect with potential clients build brand trust with them. If you’re a blogger, influencer or other personality using Instagram to build an online brand engaging with your Instagram followers is an opportunity to build real relationships with your following, and get them invested in your personal brand. Whatever your purpose for Instagram the rewards from engaging with your Instagram followers is a proven method for success.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engaging With Your Instagram Followers</strong></span></h3>
<h4>1. It Starts With Your Caption</h4>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start engaging with your Instagram followers it’s fairly easy: it starts with your caption.

<p>Share anything you want in your caption from a daily mantra, thought of the day or even details on today’s outfit. Keep whatever you decide to put in your caption as short as you can, and if you are one that prefers a longer caption use spacers and emojis to break up thoughts so it’s easier to follow. To encourage engaging with your Instagram followers be sure to include a call to action in your caption; questions seems to work best. Giving your followers something to comment about other than just your picture betters your odds in receiving comments.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2. Acknowledge And Respond To All Your Comments</h4>
<p>The biggest part of engaging with your Instagram followers no doubt comes from responding to comments left on your posts. A user leaving a like on your content is one thing, but someone taking the time to comment on your content generally means they are interested in either your post, profile, brand or all of the above. So it’s vital to capture their attention, and develop some rapport with your audience by replying to or acknowledging their comment.</p>
<p>There are instances where you might receive spam comments from the small group of profiles still automating comments, and this is something we strongly suggest you avoid. In the case of receiving spam comments, it’s your choice to either delete the comment or simply like it, depending on what the comment is and how strict you’re being when it comes to authentic engagement.</p>

<p>Of course there are times where comments left don’t allow for engaging with your Instagram followers, be it because the comment doesn’t justify a response, or because there are only so many times you can say thank you before it sounds repetitive. In these cases, simply acknowledging the comment by liking it is sufficient enough. The main point of responding to all your comments in some for and engaging with your Instagram followers is to show them and your wider audience, that you’re invested in your followers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>3. Build Meaningful Conversations</h4>
<p>Responding to your comments is a great start when we’re talking about engaging with your Instagram followers, but taking it a step further includes building meaningful conversations with them. Anyone can reply to a comment with a simple “thank you”, and although at times that’s all a comment can really be replied with trying to start a conversation with your followers has many benefits. The first and most important benefit to adding meaningful touches when engaging with your Instagram followers is you build rapport and relationships with them. Asking them questions, following up with great dialogue allows you to get to know them while they get to know you through your content. The second benefit to replying to comments when possible with open ended questions, or other forms of short conversation adds a boost to your engagement, by adding a few comments here and there while you chat with your followers.</p>

<p>You can also start these meaningful conversations as we mentioned above in your comments, after all it is the first step to engaging with your Instagram followers. A few great ways you can do that is by adding things like small anecdotes, thoughts of the day, or reviews on particular topics, and closing them off with a question to help motivate your followers and audience to interact with you and your content. Try incorporating these tips the next time you post on Instagram, and see the change in interaction from your followers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>4. Reply To All Your DMs</h4>
<p>Another big part of engaging with your Instagram followers, is staying on top of your Instagram DMs. It’s extremely important to make an effort to reply to all of your Instagram DMs, but we totally understand that it can become a lot to manage, especially if you’re a frequent poster on Instagram Stories. But we promise you, taking the time to put some focus into replying to your DMs will have a huge payoff. This is a a way you can go even further into showing your audience you care and appreciate their interactions. Just like replying to your comments we encourage you to schedule a small amount of time daily, whether it’s first thing in the morning as you do your daily emails or before you head off to bed, to turn this into a habit.</p>

<p>As much as this is an important part to engaging with your Instagram followers we do realize however that it can be a bit much to manage Instagram DMs for some so to give yourself some help with this you can try a few things. First, you can include a small “Collabs Email Only” in your bio, so that brands looking to work with you know right off the bat to email you, saving any important opportunities from slipping away in your inbox. You will of course have a few brands that out of habit will reach out via DMs, and in that case we recommend having a short script saved in your notes kindly asking they reach out via email, that you can easily copy and paste as a reply. If you feel bombarded by DMs from your Instagram Stories, you can easily turn off this feature in your Instagram settings. These two small things alone are known to reduce DMs significantly, so you can focus on replying to the rest of the DMs that come through.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5. Return Your Followers Some Love</h4>
<p>One way you can take engaging with your Instagram followers a step further, is by returning the love and engaging with their profile. This doesn’t have to be super complicated, but ultimately can have a huge pay off and is one of the top ways anyone will recommend to you when it comes to account growth. There are two main ways to go about this. The first is to identify your top followers, those who always like and comment on your posts with meaningful comments. Consider these followers your VIPs and make it a habit to visit their profiles often to engage with their content, which only helps build a strong loyalty and relationship with these users.</p>

<p>The other way you can easily incorporate this into your daily Instagram routine is as you’re replying to comments, visit a few profiles and leave them some love. It’s important to mix it up with both comments and likes, to avoid coming off spammy and also to show a genuine interest in their content. The trick to this is to truly engage with content you love so if you come across a profile that doesn’t fit your taste, don’t force yourself to comment just move to the next user. Going this extra mile in engaging with your Instagram followers has big rewards that will set you apart from other Bloggers and Influencers.</p>

<p>Like we mentioned above, there are tons of entrepreneurial inspiration Instagram accounts out there, but so many are ran anonymously, recycle the same basic quotes and don’t associate with anything to prove they even know anything about being an entrepreneur. In most cases the people running these accounts are average everyday people, and sometimes are even bot automated accounts, just looking to capture a high follower count. If real entrepreneurial inspiration, advice and experience is what you are looking for then it’s best you stick to following people who actually know what they are talking about. Luckily, we were able to scan through the millions of profiles and narrow it down to our top 10 entrepreneurial inspiration Instagram accounts we totally think you should follow.</p>

<p>Gary Vee is one of the biggest names in entrepreneurial inspiration, and there’s a good reason why. He started off his career as a wine critic but didn’t let that be what defined him. After early signs of a strong entrepreneurial spirit in his childhood, Gary quickly began finding success in the family wine business, expanding it online and through a webcast Wine Library TV, and in 2009 started a social media digital agency VaynerMedia with his brother. Gary Vee later went on to be an angel investor in social media big names like Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, along with dozens of other startups and in 2017, Entrepreneur listed his networth at $160 million. So it’s pretty clear why over 5 million people follow him on Instagram for his daily entrepreneurial inspiration and big personality. His particular knowledge of digital media makes him a great account to follow if you’re looking to start a digital agency, freelance work or are an Influencer looking to get more insight into the industry.</p>

<p>Girlboss is the digital community started by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nastygal/">Nasty Gal</a> founder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sophiaamoruso/?hl=en">Sophia Amoruso</a>. Girlboss was originally the title of her autobiography, which was later turned into a comedy series that briefly appeared on Netflix. Sophia then took Girlboss and turned it into the the perfect spot for entrepreneurial inspiration for the female entrepreneurs, especially millennials. What is so interesting with Sophia’s perspective on being an entrepreneur is her journey. Nasty Gal went from the biggest social media e-commerce success story of it’s time to bankruptcy all in under 10 years. Sophia’s experience with huge success, and just a big of failures allowed her to take her Girlboss brand and share her experiences with the following she had built as a young CEO in the social media age. We love how bright and fun the Girlboss Instagram is, where they share quotes, memes and other content all hoping to bring out the girl boss in you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Pitching brand collaborations</em> is a big part of Influencer Marketing. As an influencer or social media personality, the ultimate goal is often to work with brands on collaborations that mutually benefit both parties. As a brand, how influencers frame pitching brand collaborations is a big part of deciding to work with, and not work with. There’s a common misconception that securing brand collaborations is as easy as waiting for the email to come into your inbox. This honestly couldn’t be further from the truth. When you’re a new or rising influencer, whether it be on Instagram, Youtube, or any other social media outlet for that matter, pitching brand collaborations is a necessary step in securing a partnership. Reaching out to brands is a really humbling process that sometimes results in awesome new long-term partnerships, one time campaigns, and other times nothing at all. But getting yourself out there and pitching brand collaborations is the only way to get ahead, it’s kind of like the lottery if you don’t play you can’t win. In this article, we’re teaching you how to achieve success by sharing our top 5 tips for pitching brand collaborations and securing yourself more collaborations.</span></p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pitching Brand Collaborations: Top Tips</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #1:  Start small, think big</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first tip about pitching brand collaborations is to start small, but think big. The most important thing to remember when choosing which brands to reach out to is that collaborations must be mutually beneficial for it to make sense. This is a two-way street. In the same way that you’d want the brand to match your own personal brand, make sense for your audience and be beneficial in terms of exposure in growth, the brand you’re reaching out to will want the same synergy from you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also encourage you to be cognizant of size and reach when approaching brands. For example, an influencer with 15k followers will have a much higher success rate if he/she approaches a mixture of brands with similar followings, rather than solely approaching brands with 200k+ followers. Don’t get us wrong, we encourage you to shoot for the stars and pray you’ll land among them, but solely speaking in terms of successfully securing collaborations as a growing influencer, we suggest you start small, think big, and have goal collaborations in mind to work towards. Once you build your portfolio and can show proof of successful collaborations, you’ll have more ground to stand on when reaching out to larger, aspirational brands.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #2:  Develop a Media Kit</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never heard of a media kit? Don’t worry, lots of people haven’t, and luckily, it’s a relatively simple concept to grasp. Think of a media kit as your blog or personal brand’s equivalent of a resume. It’s a essential part of pitching brand collaborations. To provide more color, a standard media kit would include your rate card (if you’re smaller or new to the game, be sure to include that you’re open to working on a gifting basis), past work samples (photos or blog posts), past collaborations (brand names or logos), an introduction to yourself or your blog (location, defining characteristics, areas of focus) and statistics on your reach (follower count, engagement rate, gender and age demographics). After looking at your media kit, a brand should have little to no questions about who you are, what your audience looks like, and what value you’d bring to the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve come across a ton of media kits and we’ll be honest here, they’re all beautiful and nicely designed. If you’re not well-versed in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, or a program that performs similar functions, we suggest checking out <a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. Tons, dare we say hundreds, of very talented graphic designers sell media kit templates on Etsy. There’s a ton of different aesthetics and styles to choose from, so we can assure you that you won’t lose any individuality by purchasing a publicly available template. If you’re still worried about using a template that others could also purchase for use, we suggest heading to a freelance site like Freelancer to hire an affordable graphic designer to custom build your media kit for you. Both of these options vary in price, depending upon the designer you’re hiring or purchasing from, but typically range in price from $40-$200.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #3:  Craft a Smart, Concise and Compelling Email Outreach Template</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our third tip for pitching brand collaborations is to develop a smart, compelling email template to use in your outreach efforts. Developing the language for your outreach email takes a little bit of finesse. The wording in the email template needs to be vague enough to be applicable to multiple brands, but personable enough to diminish any signs that this email is being used across all of your outreach efforts. The standardized parts of your email should include your introduction to yourself and your personal brand (name, age, city, area of focus), a brief overview of your reach (ex/ My audience is composed mainly of females between the ages of 18-25, concentrated in the United States and Europe), and other self-explanatory pieces like your email signature, disclosing that your media kit is attached, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7108" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Pitching Brand Collaborations_3   Wolf Global Pitching Brand Collaborations 3 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_3-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more customized, tailored and personalized aspects of your email should be altered brand by brand. For example, the contents of your email and the little details in wording for a skincare company would differ than those used for outreach to a footwear company. It’s important to add a few sentences here and there that show you’re knowledgeable about the company, the brand, their products, etc., and aren’t just looking for free product.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #4:  Pitch Yourself and Pitch an Idea</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short and simple, brands love it when you pitch concepts or marketing ideas to them. Don’t confuse this for offering marketing concepts for the larger brand, but rather offering a marketing idea for your own channel. For example, an outreach email to a brand suggesting an Instagram story take over demonstrating their products is a much more effective way to pitch yourself than just saying “here I am and here are my statistics.” Influencer marketing teams are a growing area of concentration for both PR companies and in-house marketing teams, some of who might be less versed on the different ways to collaborate with an influencer. We encourage you to pitch yourself alongside suggesting an IG story takeover, a try on haul, or showcasing some of their new arrivals in a spring look book, for example.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to make it as easy and possible for a brand to say “yes” to working with you, and that includes offering up ideas on how you can work together in a mutually beneficial way when pitching brand collaborations.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Tip #5:  Friends Who Pitch Together, Win Together</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7110" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Pitching Brand Collaborations_5   Wolf Global Pitching Brand Collaborations 5 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Pitching-Brand-Collaborations_5-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have friends who also blog or have a presence on social media? If so, you’re in luck. When it comes to collaborating, brands really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> care about reach, follower count and engagement. If you can find innovative ways to collaborate with your influencer friends and joint-pitch a brand, you’ll find that you can secure higher quality, more prestigious collaborations. For example, if you and your blogger friend are planning a trip to Europe together, don’t hesitate to reach out to brands in a collaborative effort to pull your follower counts together. If you tell a hotel chain that both of you will be providing coverage for the brand, it’s much harder for them to deny you than if you were the only one providing exposure. Pitching brand collaborations in a team can help boost your odds of securing brand partnerships. This is a super popular method that’s used widely amongst groups of blogger friends in the industry, so don’t be scared to try it!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Instagram peer collaborations</em> can help you more than you know! Arguably one of the best parts about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is its ability to connect like minded individuals across all categories, fields of business, interests, etc. Instagram has become much more than a photo sharing app, in that way. No one can deny that Instagram has become equal parts photo sharing app and hub of connectivity. In a lot of ways, it acts as an online meet-up location for millions of people across the globe. Because Instagram is so limitless in its ability to connect you with your peers, the app has seen a wave of collaborations. I’m sure no one is a stranger to the mass of influencers and social media stars connecting with and contracting advertising work from brands. However, what’s been trending in recent times is peer-to-peer collaborations.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be clear on what we mean by Instagram peer collaborations. A great example of this is when you see bloggers sharing other blogger accounts on their Instagram stories. Yes, lots of times these posts are just people being nice and sharing inspirational accounts. However, lots of these “profile shares” are pre-arranged collaborations between a group of bloggers. This differs from brand-to-influencer collaborations in the sense that peer-to-peer collaborations are typically not paid and are a friendly effort to share followers, share exposure and grow. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll highlight different types of Instagram peer collaborations in the article below and will outline our tips for seeking out and securing collaborations.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Instagram Peer Collaborations Types</b></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Giveaways</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you’re all familiar with group giveaways and what those look like. Lots of times, groups of similar bloggers with similar followings will come together to do a giveaway with the goal of sharing followers. In this instance, the bloggers will either combine gifted items (like beauty products) or all pay into a prize together to gift to the winner. This is a great and easy way to start Instagram peer collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7031" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway-725x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global Instagram Peer Collaborations Giveaway 725x1024" width="725" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway-725x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 725w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway-212x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 212w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway-768x1085.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway-725x1024 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Giveaway-725x1024"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other situations, bloggers of all follower counts will come together and pay into a loop giveaway in order to pay a blogger with a substantially larger following to participate, as well as to purchase the gift. In this situation, there tends to be a significant increase in followers, being pulled in by the paid sponsor. However, there also tends to be way more of a drop off of followers after the giveaway closes.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Account Shares on IG Stories</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned in our example above, group account shares on IG stories is also another super popular way to collaborate with your peers. Typically, one or two bloggers will start a group direct message on Instagram with similar bloggers, asking if there’s interest in sharing each other’s accounts in an effort to share followers and exposure. I’ve seen these types of Instagram collaborations stem from already-existing engagement groups, as well.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Trips</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7032" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips-683x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Instagram Peer Collaborations_Group Trips   Wolf Global Instagram Peer Collaborations Group Trips 683x1024" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips-683x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips-200x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips-768x1152.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips-683x1024 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Group-Trips-683x1024"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This specific type of peer collaboration is more involved and more complex to carry out than a simple post to your Instagram story, but out of all the Instagram peer collaborations, has a lot of rewards. Lots of times, bloggers will team up with each other to secure sponsored trips/vacations. The total pool of followers is attractive to brands, hotel chains, etc., allowing for bloggers to travel together and create content in a sponsored environment. This type of collaboration requires a ton of intricate outreach, planning and contracts. But in the long run, you gain networking, exposure and content for your Instagram!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group Photo Meet Ups</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, another easy way to gain exposure and collaborate with your peers is arranging a photo meet-up. I’m sure you’ve seen bloggers tagged in a photo they aren’t actually in. This typically happens because Blogger B took the photo that Blogger A posted, so it’s a way of giving photography credits and lending exposure to the person who took the photo. It’s a similar process when photographers request to be tagged in the blogger photos. This type of collaboration is especially beneficial because on top of gaining more followers and exposure from being tagged in the photo you took, you’ll also get photos taken of you by the blogger you’re meeting up with. Mutually beneficial!</span></p>

<h3><b>Tips for Getting Instagram Peer Collaborations</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn to Your Existing Engagement Groups</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7033" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global Instagram Peer Collaborations Engagement Groups 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Peer-Collaborations_Engagement-Groups-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve had personal success in securing peer collaborations through leveraging contacts in our existing engagement groups. To be clear, we don’t, in any way, shape or form encourage you to turn to our Wolf Engagement Groups and post a message about collaborating. Just so we can make sure we’re on the same page, that type of post is against the rules of our engagement groups. However, you can use the member list to seek out similar accounts to yours and start a contact list to establish your own network of like-minded bloggers who you can collaborate with. Similarly, if you’re a part of any DM engagement groups, those are great contacts to reach out to about collaborating.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be Kind, Be Genuine, Be Convincing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reaching out to other influencers, or peers, for a collaboration, be sure to be kind and genuine. Someone once told us that their biggest trick to securing peer photography collaborations was by asking if they could take that person out for coffee and shoot around after. The whole “I’ll tag you if you tag me” bit came naturally when they met up for coffee and photos. Because you’re going to be the one who is actively seeking out collaborations, it’s always best to offer the person you’re reaching out to something in return, even if it’s as small as coffee. Along this same note, don’t be afraid to make your case and note that it’s mutually beneficial for peers to collaborate. In a way, reaching out for peer collaborations is like pitching a business. You’re asking someone for something, and telling them why they should invest their time in it. Just remember to always be kind, genuine and convincing in your pursuits.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be Prepared to be the Organizer</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reaching out for more complicated peer collaborations like sponsored trips or group giveaways, be prepared to be in the organizer role and be able to answer any questions your peers might have regarding the collaboration. When heading into any collaboration, it’s important to keep in mind that everyone is their own business when it comes to blogging. The trip, photo meet up or giveaway needs to be mutually beneficial for every party’s time, personal brand and business. Being able to provide a certain level of organization and leadership in collaborations is key to not only a successful collaboration, but building a lasting relationship with an industry contact. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Be Afraid To Ask</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to peer collaborations, never be afraid to ask. That phrase is far-reaching. When we say “never be afraid to ask,” we’re not just talking about asking your peers to meet up. We encourage you to never be afraid to use the follower count of a peer collaboration to joint-pitch a brand that might’ve been previously out of reach. Never be afraid to try to put together a giveaway or put yourself out there. Those who take the risks and put in the extra work are the ones who are rewarded the most.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your “Peers”</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important parts of outreach for peer collaborations is knowing who to reach out to. If you’re a photographer, reach out to other photographers with a similar style. If you’re a food blogger, reach out to other foodies. An important aspect of this also involves paying close attention to follower count. If your reach is somewhere around 10k, then sure, reach out to peers who have similar counts, but don’t expect someone with 10x your reach to participate. You’ll see much more success if you conduct outreach within your means and take risks that make sense for you and for the other party involved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Apps</em> are a big part of creating digital content for social media. Let’s face it, us Instagrammers would be nowhere without our apps. Instagram is great, in itself, but creating content for Instagram takes a lot more finesse than those 10 basic filters they provide. Whether you’re a career instagrammer or someone who uses the app for fun, we can promise you that you need these apps. We’ve taken the hard work of a lot of trial-and-error, downloads and user experience off of your plate. Over time, we’ve combed through a </span><b>ton</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of apps, covering everything from IG story templates to post planning and photo manipulation. We’re highlight our top 10 <em>apps every Instagrammer needs</em> in this article. We love these apps so much that we feel it’s appropriate to offer up a premature “you’re welcome”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This app is our saving grace when it comes to both feed planning and post planning and it’s why it’s on the top of our list of apps every Instagrammer needs. Planner has both free and paid features, but we personally feel like the free features are enough reason to download this app. Your previously posted photos are pre-loaded into the app and you have the ability to add future photos to the mix and change around the order. This has enabled us, and their thousands of other users, to strategically plan out an aesthetically pleasing feed. In addition to this feature, which to be honest, was the main reason we downloaded the app, Planner allows you to schedule posts (paid feature). If you’re running around all the time and don’t have time to post, but want to be generating content consistently on Instagram, this is a great option. It automates your posting for you, including pre-written captions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hidden feature of Planner that we find particularly helpful is the hashtags. Buried within the settings menu is a place to store hashtag groups. It’s amazing, we know. Not only does this app allow you to store hashtag groups for easy posting, but they also help you find the most popular hashtags by topic and category. For example, if you tap into their “find hashtags” tool, you’re able to type in “fashion blogger” and all of the most beneficial, popular hashtags for that category pop up for easy adding. There are tons of hashtags tools like this out there, but none that are free and as easy to use as this one. Well worth checking out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re grouping these two equally awesome apps together because you need both of them equally and both are extremely similar in function and offering. Both of these apps are great for spicing up your Instagram stories or playing around with your posts. You’ve undoubtedly seen photos or stories on your feeds that have been edited with either of these apps. They offer a selection of really cool photo frames that resemble polaroids and old Kodak film. It seems like Instagram, in general, is heading towards a more artistic, vintage feel, which explains the popularity of these photo frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6999" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold-639x1024.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Apps Every Instagrammer Needs_Unfold   Wolf Global Apps Every Instagrammer Needs Unfold 639x1024" width="639" height="1024" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold-639x1024.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 639w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold-187x300.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold-768x1230.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 799w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" title="Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold-639x1024 Wolf-Global_Apps-Every-Instagrammer-Needs_Unfold-639x1024"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to offering a cool selection of photo frames, Unfold also offers more graphic design and layout focused templates that are honestly really great. On both of these apps, there’s a selection of pre-loaded, free photo templates that are pretty good. They also offer the option to purchase other photo frame “packs.” We’ll be honest, they’re all pretty cool and we’ve bought a few of them, ourselves. These are no doubt apps every Instagrammer needs to step up their Instagram game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is a given, and it’s for a good reason. If you haven’t heard of Snapseed, you should download this app immediately. It’s basically like a mini photoshop on your phone. This app gives you the unparalleled ability to alter specific sections of your photos in terms of clarity, saturation, contrast, exposure and brightness. There are so many useful, amazing tools within this app that it’s hard to give note to all of them. This app has its own set of photo filters, specific to different themes, like “Grainy Film” or “Double Exposure.” You can even alter perspective of your photos, which is a crazy advanced option for a mobile app to offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re still discovering new features to this app on a regular basis. Feel free to drop a note in the comments below if you discover something particularly awesome about this app! We’re curious to see what you guys can do with this app that we haven’t yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us lucky people who own Adobe Lightroom on our desktops, there’s a great mobile version of this program that is unmatched in color and light manipulation. Lightroom Mobile is just as good as the desktop version if you’re doing minor changes and edits and offers nearly the same tools as the desktop software. Not much hype needs to be raised around Lightroom. The program and the sheer number of creatives who default to using the software speak to how great it is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunate side note:  If you haven’t paid for the Lightroom desktop software, the app is not available to you. Upon downloading the app, you’re asked to sign into your Adobe Creative account, after which, you’re allowed access to use Lightroom via your mobile device.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s really no getting around this one, and while we’re at it, there’s really no shame in it. People tip-toe around admitting that they use FaceTune because it has this assumption behind it that you’re severely altering the way you/your body look. FaceTune is so much more than a tool to change how big or small a part of your body is. The patch tool in FaceTune is great for getting rid of stray people/construction/other unsightly or undesired things in your photo. The detail tool is also a go-to for us. It essentially brings out all of the details in your photo and honestly makes it a lot more visually appealing and interesting to look at. There’s a number of other really useful tools like teeth or eye whitening, red eye removal and the ability to “paint” specific tones onto your photo (good for evening out skin tone, for example). The app is well worth the few dollars to download and has become one of our most-used apps when it comes to photo editing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another obvious fan-favorite, but it definitely has to be mentioned. VSCO is almost everyone’s go-to for photo filters. We have no shame in admitting that we’ve bought almost every single photo filter pack that the VSCO store has to offer, and honestly, we use most of them. The plain old color and light manipulation features are great, as well as their film grain which is classic and adjustable. Since everyone pretty much knows the deal when it comes to VSCO, we’ll give you a little extra info and share our favorite filters for purchase on the app so you have an idea of what’s worth the splurge and what isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-worth the purchase:  J-filter pack, A-filter pack, C-filter pack, M5 filter</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re into the vintage trend that’s happening all over Instagram, but aren’t that well versed in photo editing, Huji Cam is a great alternative. This app is super easy to use and doesn’t require a ton of post-process editing. It gives your photos a distinctly vintage/film aesthetic, instantly giving any color in the shot a nice boost and more visual interest. We know a ton of people who are non-bloggers and non-photographers that revert to using this app instead of spending 20 minutes navigating the tons of editing apps we’ve mentioned in this article. </span></p>

There’s a ton of little buttons and toggles on the 8MM app to give your videos a little extra spice, including little glitch-type edits. This app functions, essentially, like a different type of camera and gives any video content a really fun, old school, almost romantic element. If you’re a fan of mega-blogger (and mega-babe) @tezza, you’ve seen this app in action. She uses 8MM, exclusively, for most of her fun IG stories. Check it out if you’re curious to see what this app can do before purchasing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FotoRus is the hidden gem of photo editing apps. Chances are, you haven’t heard of this app yet, and to be honest, we kind of found it by accident. We personally use this app exclusively to lengthen the body/legs in shots that were taken from a higher angle (which makes the subject of the photo appear shorter). That being said, if you’re really into post-process editing or if you need a little extra help on a specific photo, this app is a must. There’s even a beauty section of the app that will apply full-blown makeup onto your face and it’s all customizable. While we’d never suggest fully changing your appearance using apps like FotoRus, we’ve found it particularly helpful in a number of instances. For example, if you want to share your new favorite mascara, but the photo doesn’t do it justice, there’s a mascara option in the beauty section of FotoRus that will give your lashes an extra boost. Pretty cool, right? Just be careful not to over do it! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a more professional camera, like a Canon or a Nikon, do yourself a favor and download the app. Most of these professional cameras these days have built-in WiFi systems. Such a blessing for us Instagrammers. Our Canon Connect app allows us to take photos using our phones as a remote control, allows us to download photos that are on our SD cards straight into our phones and gives you control over lighting, focus and location tracking on your camera. Pretty cool, right? These cameras are typically really expensive, so the apps really allow you to get the most out of your investment.</span></p>

Even if you’re new to the world of Social Media or perhaps not the best with technology, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is an extremely user friendly platform.

<p>If you’re beginning to think that maybe you should be starting an Instagram account there really is no better time. Starting an Instagram account is easy, but just in case you’re feeling a little intimidated about the whole thing we’re helping you out with our guide to starting an Instagram account.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Starting An Instagram Account: The Basics</strong></span></h3>
<h4>Pick A Username</h4>
<p>The first thing to starting an Instagram account is pretty straight forward – picking an Instagram username. With over 800 million users, the typical Instagram usernames are probably taken by now so you might need to get creative. We recommend that no matter what you decide to go with in terms of a username, if you’re starting an Instagram for your business or brand it should obviously include something relating to your company name. Your username should also be as short as possible and something that rolls of the tongue and is easy to remember.</p>
<h4>Personalize Your Profile</h4>
<p>Now that you’re well on your way to starting an Instagram account it’s time to work on your overall profile. The two things you 100% need are a display picture and some sort of bio. For your display picture, use something that represents you and your brand, be it a selfie or your logo. If you are using an image of yourself, we recommend picking an image that works for the type of account you’re starting. If you’re starting an Instagram account that’s for your professional career, you might want to stick to a professional looking headshot over a picture from you out at the bar last night. Whatever you choose to use your picture should be clear and identifiable especially seeing how small it is.</p>

<p>For your Instagram bio look at keeping it short, sweet and to the point. Thinking of adding a tagline, short bits of information or other text that describes who you are or what your account’s purpose is. Keeping your bio’s content clean and easy to read is the best way to have your profile catching attention. If you’re starting an Instagram account for your brand or business we recommend that you link your Instagram to your Facebook page and switch to a business account. This allows you access to a bunch of features including setting an industry for your profile, adding contact information and the ability to use the tag to shop feature. You can also add clickable username tags and hashtags in your profile, and we recommend doing that especially if you have other affiliated Instagram accounts or a brand hashtag. Don’t forget to add your website into your profile to drive traffic!</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Starting An Instagram Account: Next Steps</strong></span></h3>
<h4>Generate Content</h4>
<p>There’s a lot more to starting an Instagram account than setting up your profile and if we’re being honest that’s the easy part. But if you ask us the fun part of running an Instagram account has to be the content creation! It’s important that you’re publishing captivating and meaningful content that fits your brand and accurately delivers your message. If you’re a photographer, blogger, content creator or any other type of creative, then chances are you have an arsenal of content waiting to be published. On the other hand if you’re a business owner that’s not in a creative field you probably aren’t that handy when it comes to digital content let alone have the time to create it. You’re sure to have some visual content especially if you’ve built a website or have a Facebook page so recycling that content for Instagram is more than okay. But if you haven’t had much of any online presence and are lacking content don’t worry you’re not out of luck.</p>

<p>If content creation isn’t your strong suit then there are a few options you can go with to generate content that involve using the content creation skills of other people. Obviously if your business or brand has a marketing team on staff, then chances are both the content creation and entire account management will probably be left to them. If you’re a small business however your first option is either hiring an employee to manage this or a freelancer if you don’t have the budget for a salaried employee. With a freelancer you have the option to hire them to just create content or manage the entire account but depending on what you choose the cost will of course differ. You can then give them as little or as much direction as you see fit to create content for your brand.</p>
<p>Freelancers do come at a price though so if your budget really does not have much room to hire someone, you still do have a few options. You can first search free stock images on sites like <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> to find content to publish. The downside to this is many others go with this route not just on Instagram but for all their digital content which means that there is a lack of uniqueness when using stock images. If you’d prefer to use original content for your Instagram account you can look to influencer marketing to help generate content, this does usually come at a cost either by offering your product or service, and even compensation depending on the influencer’s reach. Reposting fan content is also a great way to get some content going on your page without spending a dime however we recommend if you’re going this route to credit the creator by tagging them in the image and caption.</p>
<h4>Build A Plan</h4>
<p>Now that you’ve got your content figured out, it’s time to workout an overall plan. Starting an Instagram account especially if there is a purpose behind takes a little more than just posting and going.

<p>If you’re looking to do all the work yourself, start backwards by determine what goal you want to achieve with your Instagram presence. Are you looking to grow an audience, drive sales to your website, or maybe both? Depending on what your end goal is with Instagram, your strategy may slightly vary. Social media marketing takes a lot of classic marketing’s techniques and applies it to digital spaces. Start off small with your plan; It’s okay to plan 6 months or even 12 months out but when you’re starting an Instagram account it’s vital that you start small and work your way into a bigger strategy. Especially when you’re just starting out it’s not always obviously what’s going to work for you, your brand and overall results so it’s much easier to tweak a month vs 365 days work of planning. Begin to plan for 1 month, then once you feel comfortable with the flow move into quarterly planning and build out from there.. Whatever you choose to do just make sure your plan is something realistic for you to achieve.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do to help grow your following and build your brand on Instagram is engaging with your audience. This may seem fairly obvious but the truth is many influencers and brands alike neglect their followers. It’s vital that you respond to every DM, preferably within 24-48 hours of receipt, and acknowledge ever comment left on your content. Even if it’s something you can reply to, just by liking the comment or leaving an emoji or “thanks” really goes a long way.</p>
<h4><strong>Learn The Tricks</strong></h4>
<p>As we mentioned, your Instagram strategy should be one that’s forever changing and evolving with both your brand and the platform. It’s important if you’re taking your Instagram seriously that you keep up with all features, updates and general news so that you’re aware with what’s coming. It’s also good if you continuously learn tricks on content creation, account management and follower growth so you can keep your strategy at the top of its game. There are so many YouTubers, writers, websites and other resources all dedicated to the world of Instagram that you can reference.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram loop giveaways something you’ve been thinking about adding to your </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy? Well in this article, we’re going to get candid with you about the much-discussed Instagram loop giveaways. Some people hate Instagram loop giveaways, others love them, and lots of people are curious about them. Instagram loop giveaways have a lot of benefits, but to be honest, they also some negatives. In this post, we’re laying it all out on the table for you so you can make the best decision for your own page and personal growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re totally new to the concept of Instagram loop giveaways, don’t worry. Chances are, you’ve seen what we’re talking about on your Instagram feed, even if you haven’t immediately noticed it. Instagram loop giveaways are essentially just contents run on Instagram with prize rewards and multiple participants. We’ve seen a number of different requirements listed in order to be entered to win, but typically it includes having to follow a list of people specified in the caption.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Instagram Loop Giveaways: The Standard</strong></h3>
<h4>1) A group of participants is established</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number and quality of participants in an Instagram loop giveaway will vary based on how the giveaway is set up. We’ve seen loop giveaways being hosted amongst a group of like-minded bloggers as a fun and innovative way to share followers and boost numbers. In these cases, all of the participants are, at the very least, familiar with one another. Other times, though, the people in your loop giveaway could be complete strangers, where the participant list is established by a third party service that hosts loop giveaways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6903" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1-1024x705.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Instagram Loop Giveaways_1   Wolf Global Instagram Loop Giveaways 1 1024x705" width="1024" height="705" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1-1024x705.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1-300x207.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1-768x529.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1-1024x705 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_1-1024x705"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, when participating in an Instagram loop giveaway arranged by a third party loop giveaway service, there will be a sponsor involved. The sponsor is someone who is really prominent on Instagram and has a lot of engaged, high quality followers. This person is really pulling the weight in terms of giveaway entrants and follower gain. Their mass of followers is where the bulk of your growth will come from, and typically, the price you pay to buy into the giveaway will pay the sponsor for their participation.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2) A prize reward is chosen and purchased for the giveaway winner(s)</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prize reward often varies based on the situation. The most common prizes for Instagram loop giveaways run by third party services are designer goods, like a Louis Vuitton Never-Full bag, or a Gucci wallet. Lots of other popular go-to’s for giveaways are Apple products like iMacs, iPhones and iPads. In recent times, travel or “getaway” giveaways have been super popular, rewarding the winner(s) with trips to fun destinations with a combination of flights, hotel stays, excursions, etc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the less-common situations where brands will participate in or run their own Instagram loop giveaway, that brand will typically supply the reward/gift for the winners. Similarly, in Instagram loop giveaways hosted by groups of like-minded bloggers, they usually all pitch in to buy a gift of their choosing.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>3) A “Loop Order” is Created in List Form</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the list of participants is finalized, each participant is given the IG handle of the person directly after them on the list. That person’s IG handle is to be include in the caption. This is designed so that entrants can easily click through each caption, and thereby, easily click through (and follow) the list of participants for the Instagram loop giveaway.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>4) Caption &amp; Posting Date are Established</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6905" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3-1024x768.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Instagram Loop Giveaways_3   Wolf Global Instagram Loop Giveaways 3 1024x768" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3-1024x768.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3-300x225.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3-768x576.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3-1024x768 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_3-1024x768"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most important part of an Instagram loop giveaway is the posting time/date and making sure that everyone adheres to it. Everyone posts at the same time and same day to maximize exposure and follower gain. Closer to the established posting date, each participant is given a scripted caption to use on the giveaway post. As mentioned above, the caption includes the username of the person below you on the “loop order” list. In addition, the caption will contain giveaway rules, end date, guidelines, and regulatory info (indicating that the giveaway is, in no way, hosted by or related to Instagram).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have the basics down, let’s get down to the nitty gritty of Instagram loop giveaways. We have a lot of feelings about Instagram loop giveaways, both good and bad. We’ve participated in them and can speak from experience when we say that the benefit of the giveaway really depends on the individual giveaway itself. Below, we’ve outlined the major pro’s and con’s of participating in these types of giveaways:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The follower growth is always an uncertain thing when it comes to Instagram loop giveaways, but it’s clearly the reason why everyone’s hopping onto this trend. Sometimes you get a tons of followers, and honestly, sometimes you don’t. The great thing about the follower gain is that it boosts your numbers, no matter how small the gain, and ultimately helps to get both your follower and engagement numbers up.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe the best thing about loop giveaways is the exposure it gives you. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people are being exposed to you that normally wouldn’t have come across your page. It opens up the opportunity for more friends, more followers, more collaborations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loop giveaways are a great way to network and interact with other bloggers in your peer group. We’ve not only made friends from joining loop giveaways, but we’ve experienced the added benefits of engagement groups, introductions to photographers, shared industry contacts, and greater exposure to collaboration opportunities.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Instagram Loo Giveaways: The Cons</strong></h3>
<h4>1) Follower “Drop Off”</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6910" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Instagram Loop Giveaways_8   Wolf Global Instagram Loop Giveaways 8 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_8-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, just to be totally honest, with a lot of loop giveaways, the follower drop off is really high. Tons of people participate in the giveaway in the hopes of winning the prize, but shortly after the giveaway winner is announced, a decent percent of those people go on unfollow sprees. We’ve seen as much as a 70% drop off in followers following a giveaway. One of the tips with loop giveaways is to make sure your page is eye-catching or differentiated enough to make people want to follow you. High quality content will make loop giveaway contestants think twice about hitting “unfollow.” </span></p>
<h4>2) High Buy-In Prices</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6914" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-1024x684.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Instagram Loop Giveaways_9   Wolf Global Instagram Loop Giveaways 9 1024x684" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-1024x684.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-768x513.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-1024x684 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_9-1024x684"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the prizes for the giveaway have to be purchased by the loop giveaway participants or by the third party manager, the buy in prices can be pretty high. The buy in prices are exceptionally high when there’s a sponsor involved, as their participation fees can be expensive. All of the participants split the total cost of the giveaway (sponsor + prize + shipping), so the more participants, the less money to buy in. However, with that being said, the more Instagram accounts that giveaway contestants have to enter to win, the less followers you’ll gain.</span></p>
<h4>3) No Guarantee</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third party loop giveaway hosts often have “sign up” Instagram accounts where they’ll post upcoming giveaways and information about sponsors, buy in prices, rules, etc. In those posts they’ll often give an estimated follower count (typically a range). However, third party loop giveaway hosts will disclose in their posts that they cannot guarantee specific numbers of followers. So, to keep it short and sweet, if you pay $500 for an awesome giveaway with great gifts and sponsors and 100% of the followers drop off after the giveaway closes, you’re out of luck.</span></p>
<h4>4) Perception</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6915" src="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" alt="Wolf Global_Instagram Loop Giveaways_10   Wolf Global Instagram Loop Giveaways 10 1024x683" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-1024x683.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-300x200.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-768x512.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-900x600.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=216&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=432&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=648&amp;ssl=1 648w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=2160&amp;ssl=1 2160w, https://wolfglobal-org-blog.exactdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10.jpg?strip=all&amp;lossy=1&amp;w=3240&amp;ssl=1 3240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-1024x683 Wolf-Global_Instagram-Loop-Giveaways_10-1024x683"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, a lot of people have negative things to say about loop giveaways. We often see influencers, both big and small in followers, posting Instagram stories and voicing their opinions about loop giveaways. A popular one is that, while loop giveaways increase your follower count, it’s not really genuine growth. From this standpoint, people who follow you in order to win a prize are worth less than someone who followed you for you, your style, your photography, whatever it is that makes you, you. And truth be told, sometimes they can be less engaged, less active, less relevant, and from a marketing/collaboration standpoint, less profitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So after hearing how Instagram loop giveaways work, and both their pros and cons is this something you’re interested in adding to your Instagram strategy?
